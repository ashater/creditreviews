Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\\'s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.\\\\n\\\\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\\'s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy Barnum.\\\\n\\\\nMr. Barnum, please go ahead. ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\\\n\\\\nJeremy Barnum Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\\\n\\\\nThank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\\\\n\\\\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57 on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This quarter, we had two significant items in Corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment securities losses.\\\\n\\\\nTouching on a few highlights, combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year-on-year with growth in both discretionary and non-discretionary spending. We ended the year ranked #1 for Global IB fees, with a wallet share of 8%, and credit continues to normalize but actual performance remains strong across the company.\\\\n\\\\nOn page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year-on-year. NII ex Markets was up $8.4 billion or 72%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as management and performance fees in AWM, lower Auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up $382 million or 7% year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nExpenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion was driven by updates to the firm\\'s macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case, as well as loan growth in Card Services, partially offset by a reduction in pandemic-related uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\nLooking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%.\\\\n\\\\nOnto balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, primarily driven by the benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA. RWA declined approximately $20 billion quarter-on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business which was partially offset by an increase in lending, primarily in Card Services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached one quarter early. So, given that, we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let\\'s go to our businesses starting on page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of US consumers and small businesses based on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data.\\\\n\\\\nCombined debit and credit spend is up 9% year-on-year. Both discretionary and non-discretionary spend are up year-on-year, the strongest growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year.\\\\n\\\\nE-commerce spend was up 7%, while in-person spend was roughly flat. Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income segments are expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter this year.\\\\n\\\\nNow, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which was up 29% year-on- year. You\\'ll notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there, revenue was up 56% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter as spend remains strong and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships.\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\nJPMorGAN CHASE & Co.\\\\n\\\\nClient investment assets were down 10% year-on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows – where we are seeing good momentum, including from our deposit customer. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year-on-year, largely driven by lower production revenue.\\\\n\\\\nMoving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20%, and we are now back to pre-pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre-pandemic levels, which should be a tailwind in 2023. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%.\\\\n\\\\nExpenses of $8 billion were up 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by Auto lease depreciation from lower volumes. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800 million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending, and net charge-offs of $845 million, up $330 million year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nNext, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 57% year-on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions resulting in fees down 58% for debt and down 69% for equity.\\\\n\\\\nIn terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook. Also, note that it will be a difficult compare against last year\\'s first quarter.\\\\n\\\\nMoving to Markets, revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year-on-year, driven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets, while Securitized Products continue to be challenged by the market environment. Equity Markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year.\\\\n\\\\nPayments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56% and the year-on-year growth was driven by higher rates. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits and market levels.\\\\n\\\\nExpenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year-on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenue-related compensation. On a full-year basis, expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation.\\\\n\\\\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up 30% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue and deposit-related fees. Gross Investment Banking revenue of $700 million was down 52% year-on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nDeposits were down 14% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of non-operating deposits. Loans were up 14% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates, which impacts both originations and prepayment activity.\\\\n\\\\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre-tax margin of 33%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 3% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances, predominantly offset by reductions in management, performance and placement fees linked to this year\\'s market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were up 1% year-on- year, predominantly driven by growth in our private banking advisor teams, largely offset by lower performance-related compensation.\\\\n\\\\nFor the quarter, net long-term inflows were $10 billion, positive across Equities and Fixed Income, and $47 billion for the full year. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 trillion and overall client assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year-on-year, respectively, driven by lower market levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter- on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending; while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by the rising rate environment – resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives.\\\\n\\\\nTurning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion year-on-year. NII was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and reflects the two significant items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year-on-year.\\\\n\\\\nWith that, let\\'s pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on page 10. Okay. We expect total NII to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for 2023.\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nJPMorGAN CHASE & Co.\\\\n\\\\nGoing through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of the hike in late December, the hikes expected early in the year, and the cuts expected later in the year should be a net tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both Wholesale and Consumer.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall Card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances, given modest attrition in both Consumer and Wholesale.\\\\n\\\\nI think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely – and that\\'s just a level of precision that we\\'re just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we\\'ll be faced with as a company are respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with a strategy, which is about growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost. So, in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for deposits, as I said.\\\\n\\\\nJamie, you want to add something? ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\\\n\\\\nJamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\\\\n\\\\nErika, I just want to give a big picture about why I do not consider $74 billion conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in T-bills, money market funds, and of course, banks are competing for the capital money now and banks are all in a different place. And some banks have started to compete heavily. Some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less.\\\\n\\\\nBut if you look at prior – and forget what happened in 2016 – I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We\\'ve never had zero rates. We\\'ve never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CDs, more migration to money market funds. A lot of people are there competing for it and we\\'re going to have to change savings rates. We can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are doing. We don\\'t know the timing, but it will happen.\\\\n\\\\nAnd I just also want to point out that even at $74 billion, we\\'re earning quite good returns. We\\'ve always pointed out to you all that sometimes we\\'re over-earning and sometimes we\\'re under-earning. I would say, okay, this time we\\'re over-earning on NII this quarter. We\\'re maybe over- earning on credit. We may be under-earning on something else. So these are still very good numbers and we\\'re going to wait and see and we\\'ll report to you. But I don\\'t want to give you false notions how secure it is. ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\\\n\\\\nErika Najarian Analyst, UBS Securities LLC\\\\n\\\\nAnd my follow-up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let\\'s zoom out for a second here – to your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession, and I\\'m going to re-ask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day even with the headwind in NII and the headwind in the provision? ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\\\\n\\\\nJamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\", \\'JPM-10K-2021.pdf\\': \"The Firm’s website is www.jpmorganchase.com.

Non-interest revenue declined 11% to $62 billion due to lower investment banking fees, securities losses, and lower mortgage/auto revenues.\n\n- Provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting a $3.5 billion addition to loan loss reserves driven by a deteriorating economic outlook and loan growth, partially offset by improving pandemic impacts.\n\n- Expenses increased 7% to $76.1 billion due to higher structural costs and investments in business.\n\nRevenue Factors:\n- Higher interest rates provided a significant tailwind to net interest income\n- Investment banking fees declined sharply on lower market activity\n- Trading revenue was higher, benefiting from volatility \n\nCost/Cash Flow:\n- Expenses rose from investments in technology, marketing, and compensation\n- Cash flow impacted by additions to loan loss reserves\n\nCredit Quality:\n- Loan loss reserves increased $3.5 billion on economic outlook concerns\n- Non-performing assets declined $1.1 billion as consumer credit improved\n\nOutlook/Projections:\n- JPMorgan projects 2023 net interest income of $73 billion, reflecting rate increases offset by deposit repricing\n- Expects modest loan growth and lower deposits due to attrition\n- Sees continued normalization in consumer credit metrics like revolving balances\n\nThe company also provided its calculation of credit score based on EPS of $12.09 and stock price of $138.13 at year-end 2022, which results in a credit score of 4.2 using the provided tool.\n\nIn summary, while JPMorgan faced headwinds in 2022 from the operating environment, its core businesses showed resilience and it remains well-capitalized, though it is bracing for a potential recession impacting 2023 results."
