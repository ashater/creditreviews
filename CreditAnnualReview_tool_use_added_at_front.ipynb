Wholesale loan growth remains strong.\n\nOutlook for 2023:\n\n- JPMorgan expects full year 2023 net interest income of ~$73 billion, driven by higher rates, partially offset by expected deposit repricing.\n\n- Modest overall loan growth projected, with Card revolving balances expected to be a tailwind.\n\n- Expense outlook incorporates investments in business and technology, while managing compensation/volume-related expenses prudently.\n\n- Credit costs expected to remain elevated as economic conditions weaken.\n\n- Firm reached 13% CET1 ratio target ahead of schedule and plans to resume share repurchases in Q1 2023.\n\nSo while JPMorgan faced headwinds in 2022 from the capital markets environment, it benefited from higher rates and continues to see relatively solid client activity. However, the economic outlook has weighed on credit reserves and profitability outlook."

Return on equity was 14% and return on tangible common equity was 18% for the year.\n\nOn the revenue side:\n- Total net revenue was $128.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year\n- Net interest income was $66.7 billion, up 28% driven by higher rates and loan growth, offset partially by lower Markets net interest income\n- Net interest income excluding Markets was up 40% to $62.4 billion\n\nThe significant increase in net interest income was a positive factor aided by the higher rate environment. However, the decline in Markets' net interest income impacted overall growth.\n\nNon-interest revenue details were not provided, so assessing fee income sources is difficult. Cost structure and operating leverage trends are also unclear from the given information.\n\nOverall, JPMorgan showed revenue growth in 2022 but profitability was pressured. The higher rate environment supported net interest income, but other business weaknesses like lower Markets revenues impacted earnings growth. A more comprehensive review of non-interest revenues, expense management and capital positioning would provide a fuller perspective."
