        "text": "Human Capital\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees. The Company recognizes that supporting, engaging and continuously upskilling its workforce is key to meeting evolving corporate and customer needs. To further those efforts, the Company is dedicated to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment; providing pay that is competitive and fair, as well as other benefits and programs that promote wellness; and supporting employees\u2019 professional development through programs that promote engagement, learning and productivity. As of December 31, 2023, the Company employed a total of 75,465 employees globally.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion The Company continues to expand its talent pipeline to increase the representation of women at leadership levels and people of color at all levels, including at the executive and senior management levels. The Company\u2019s hiring program strives to include the inclusion of at least one woman or one person of color on interview slates for all roles at the Company. In addition, the Company offers various mentorship, leadership and development opportunities that enable participants, including women and people of color, to enhance networks, key skills and work experiences. The Company also provides inclusive leadership learning journeys designed to coach and develop its leaders in driving employee and team performance through inclusive behaviors and best practices.\n\nTo help create and sustain an inclusive workforce, the Company sponsors Business Resource Groups (\u201cBRGs\u2019\u2019), including Asian heritage, Black heritage, Nosotros Latinos, Indigenous Peoples, U.S. Bank women, Spectrum LGBTQ, Proud to Serve: Military and Veterans, European Inclusion, and Disability employee groups, with chapters across the Company and membership available to all employees. These BRGs enable employees from a wide variety of backgrounds, identities and perspectives to connect in ways that empower them to contribute, innovate and grow. Through these BRGs, employees can come together to discuss topics of interest to them, develop professional skills and build overall employee engagement,\n\nhelping to create and sustain an inclusive workforce that drives business growth and propels accountability for diversity and inclusion within the Company.\n\nThese programs, practices and policies are part of the Company\u2019s strategy to have an ethnically and gender diverse employee base. As of December 31, 2023, of the Company\u2019s employees in the United States, 57 percent were women and 39 percent were people of color. As of December 31, 2023, 34 percent of the Company\u2019s employees at the executive and senior management levels in the United States were women and 21 percent were people of color. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, of the Company\u2019s 13 directors, 5 were women and 4 were people of color. All diversity information is based on information self- disclosed by the employee or director to the Company. To provide transparency on progress relating to its commitment to seek and promote diverse talent, the Company publicly discloses consolidated EEO-1 data on its website.",

        "text": "Equitable and Competitive Compensation, Health & Wellness Programs Maintaining competitive compensation and benefits practices is a continued focus for the Company, with periodic peer and benchmarking reviews used to assist with competitive alignment and employee retention. The Company remains committed to fair pay and continues to prioritize pay equity efforts. To further the Company\u2019s efforts to provide fair and equitable compensation to its employees, the Company has processes to address any gender and racial pay inequities identified within its workforce. This work starts with fair hiring practices. The Company also has guidelines in place for both internal and external job postings to assist the Company\u2019s leaders in making fair compensation decisions based on the demands and responsibilities of each role, candidate experience, and pay related to comparable internal positions. As part of the Company's efforts to enhance pay transparency, all open positions in the United States have a disclosed compensation range. The Company conducts periodic reviews of base pay of employee groups across gender and racial categories with the assistance of an independent third-party consultant. Should gender or race- based disparities in pay be identified, the Company adjusts compensation levels to eliminate those disparities. In the 2023 review, on average, employees of the Company in the United States who are women were paid greater than 99 percent of what their male counterparts were paid, and employees of the Company in the United States who are people of color were paid greater than 99 percent of what their white counterparts were paid, in each case taking into account several factors including comparable jobs, experience and location. The 2023 review excluded employees from the MUB acquisition who had not transitioned into the Company's pay structures.\n\nThe Company also provides its employees with comprehensive benefits programs, including competitive healthcare, retirement, leave, recognition, wellness, disability, life insurance, time-off, flexible work, and educational assistance programs, based on the Company\u2019s recognition that such benefits are important to attract and retain employees. In addition to its competitive 401(k) matching program, the Company maintains an active cash balance pension program for its U.S. employees, including newly hired employees.\n\nThe Company continues to support flexible work programs with remote and in-person work arrangements, providing additional optionality and flexibility for most employees, which helps the Company attract and retain talent. The Company continues to adapt and evolve its flexible work programs as it recognizes the changes to employee and customer priorities and its customers\u2019 and employees' changing needs.\n\nEmployee Engagement and Retention As patt of its efforts to develop and retain skilled employees, the Company remains focused on monitoring employee engagement. The Company\u2019s employee listening program enables the Company to collect quantitative and qualitative feedback from employees on an ongoing basis, which then supports and informs the Company on human capital strategies and decisions.",

        "text": "Competition\n\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, investment companies, credit card companies and a variety of other financial services, advisory and technology companies. The financial services industry continues to undergo rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including innovative ways that customers can make payments or manage their accounts, such as through the use of mobile payments, digital wallets or digital currencies. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding companies, including by financial technology companies, or \u201cfintechs,\u201d which may offer bank-like products or services that compete directly with the Company\u2019s products and services. Competition is based on a number of factors, including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience, including the ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services that customers want to adopt. The Company\u2019s ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on its ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs. For additional information relating to how the Company attracts and retains employees, see \u201cHuman Capital\u201d above.\n\nGovernment Policies\n\nThe operations of the Company\u2019s various businesses are affected by federal and state laws and legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities of the numerous states in which they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These laws, rules and policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d), United States fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary policies and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank regulatory agencies.",

This regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the deposit insurance fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \u201cFDIC\u201d), consumers, the stability of the financial system in the United States, and the health of the national economy, and not for investors in the Company.\n\nThis section summarizes certain provisions of the principal laws and regulations applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. The descriptions are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes and regulations described below.\n\nGeneral As a BHC, the Company is subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve. USBNA and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation, examination and supervision primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the \u201cOCC\u201d) and also by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) in certain areas.\n\nSupervision and regulation by the responsible regulatory agencies generally include comprehensive annual reviews of all major aspects of the Company\u2019s and USBNA\u2019s business and condition, regular on-site examinations, and imposition of periodic reporting requirements and limitations on investments and certain types of activities. If an applicable regulatory agency deems the Company to be operating in a manner that is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices, such agency can require the entry into informal or formal supervisory agreements, including board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders, pursuant to which the Company would be required to take identified corrective actions to address cited concerns and to refrain from taking certain actions. Supervision and examinations are confidential, and the outcomes of these actions generally are not made public.\n\nBanking and other financial services statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by the United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies.

Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on its business or organization.\n\nAs a BHC with over $100 billion in total consolidated assets, the Company is subject to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s enhanced prudential standards, as applied to \u201cCategory III\u201d institutions under the federal banking regulators\u2019 rules that tailor how enhanced prudential standards apply to large U.S. banking organizations (the \u201cTailoring Rules\u201d). The Tailoring Rules also apply certain enhanced prudential standards to its subsidiary depository institution, USBNA, as described in more detail below.\n\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s acquisition of MUB, the Company committed (the \u201cFederal Reserve Commitments\u201d) to submit to the Federal Reserve quarterly implementation plans for complying with requirements applicable to \u201cCategory II\u201d institutions (i.e., institutions with $700 billion or more in total assets or $75 billion or more in cross-jurisdictional activities). The Company also committed to meet requirements applicable to Category II institutions by the earlier of (i) the date required under the Tailoring Rules; and (ii) December 31, 2024, if the Federal Reserve notifies the Company by January 1, 2024, that the Company must comply with such rules. On October 16, 2023, the Federal Reserve granted the Company relief from both of these commitments. As a result, the Company will continue to be subject to the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to Category III institutions until otherwise required under the Tailoring Rules (i.e., until the Company\u2019s total average consolidated assets for the then most recent four quarters equal $700 billion or more or the amount of the Company\u2019s average cross-jurisdictional activities for the then most recent four quarters equals $75 billion or more).\n\nSupervisory Ratings Federal banking regulators regularly examine the Company and its insured depository institution subsidiary, USBNA. Following those exams, the Company (under the Federal Reserve\u2019s Large Financial Institution Rating System) and USBNA (under the CAMELS rating system) are assigned supervisory ratings. Disclosure of these ratings to third parties is not allowed without permission of the issuing regulator. A downgrade in these ratings could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time, require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments, affect USBNA\u2019s deposit insurance assessment rates, limit the Company's access to funding through government-sponsored liquidity programs, and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements, as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the Company.\n\nBHC Activities The Company is a BHC under the BHC Act and has elected to be a financial holding company (\u201cFHC\u201d). BHCs that qualify and elect to be treated as FHCs may engage in, and affiliate with financial companies engaging in, a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a BHC.",

See \u201cPermissible Business Activities\u201d below. Disclosure of any failure to meet these standards is not allowed without permission of the Federal Reserve. If the failure to meet these standards persists, the FHC may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by BHCs that are not FHCs. In addition, if a depository institution controlled by an FHC does not receive a Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) rating of at least \u201csatisfactory\u201d at its most recent examination, the Federal Reserve will prohibit the FHC from conducting new business activities that FHCs are generally permitted to conduct and from making certain acquisitions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also requires BHCs to meet certain applicable capital and management standards. Failure by the Company to meet these standards could limit the Company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.\n\nPermissible Business Activities As an FHC, the Company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. \u201cFinancial in nature\u201d activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the United States Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. \u201cComplementary activities\u201d are activities that the Federal Reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk.\n\nThe Company generally is not required to obtain Federal Reserve approval to acquire a company engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as long as the Company meets the capital, managerial and CRA requirements to qualify as an FHC. However, the Company is required to receive approval for an acquisition in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed $10 billion.

In addition, banks must receive approval before they may acquire, merge with, acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume any deposits of a bank or savings association and may be required to receive approval for acquisitions of other companies.\n\nInterstate Banking A BHC may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years). Also, such an acquisition is not permitted if the BHC controls, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, if the acquisition is the BHC\u2019s initial entry into the state, more than 30 percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state (or any lesser or greater amount set by the state). Banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state.\n\nRegulatory Approval for Acquisitions In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors, including the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition and future prospects (including current and projected capital ratios and levels); the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations; the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the CRA); the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities; and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system. In addition, approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for well-capitalized and well-managed institutions.\n\nSource of Strength The Company is required to act as a source of strength to USBNA, and to commit capital and financial resources to support USBNA circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so. Under these requirements, the Federal Reserve may in the future require the Company to provide financial assistance to USBNA, should it experience financial distress. Capital loans by the Company to USBNA would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of USBNA.",

The OCC may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards.\n\nEnhanced Prudential Standards Under the Dodd-Frank Act, as modified by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act and the Tailoring Rules, large bank holding companies, such as the Company, are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards based on the banking organization\u2019s size and certain \u201crisk-based indicators.\u201d The prudential standards include enhanced risk-based capital and leverage requirements, enhanced liquidity requirements, enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements, a requirement to submit a resolution plan, single-counterparty credit limits and stress tests. Certain of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the Company are described below in further detail.\n\nDividend Restrictions The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Typically, the majority of the Company\u2019s operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the Company by USBNA. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks. In general, dividends payable by USBNA and the Company\u2019s trust bank subsidiaries, as national banking associations, are limited by rules that compare dividends net income for periods defined by regulation.\n\nto\n\nThe OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise (including the Company and USBNA) if, in the banking regulator\u2019s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve\u2019s final rule implementing the stress capital buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) provides that a BHC must receive prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan. The rule also provides that a BHC must resubmit its capital plan if, among other things, the BHC determines there has been or will be a material change in the BHC\u2019s risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since the BHC last submitted its capital plan.\n\nCapital Requirements The Company is subject to certain regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the Federal Reserve, and USBNA is subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the OCC. These rules implement the Basel Committee\u2019s framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (\u201cBasel III\u2019\u201d\u2019), as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that a banking organization, based on its size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner.",

Growth in total consolidated assets (including assets obtained in acquisitions) or cross-jurisdictional activity (as defined in the Tailoring Rules) could affect the Company\u2019s continued classification as a \u201cCategory III\u201d institution, which could result in the Company and its insured depository institution subsidiary becoming \u201cadvanced approaches\u201d banking organizations, a requirement to recognize elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital, as well as other more stringent capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements.\n\nUnder the United States Basel III-based capital rules, the Company is subject to a minimum common equity tier 1 (\u201c\u201cCET1\u201d) capital ratio (CET capital to risk-weighted assets) of 4.5 percent, a minimum tier | capital ratio of 6.0 percent and a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0 percent. At December 31, 2023, the Company exceeded these minimum capital ratio requirements. The Company is also subject to the SCB, which is based on the results of the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory stress tests and the Company\u2019s planned common stock dividends, and, if deployed by the Federal Reserve, up to a 2.5 percent common equity tier | countercyclical capital buffer. These additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as CET1. Although the Federal Reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent, the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future. The SCB generally is assigned on an annual basis and becomes effective on October 1 of each year, subject to a 2.5 percent floor, and may vary over time. As of December 31, 2023, the SCB applicable to the Company is 2.5 percent. If the Federal Reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer, or if the SCB applicable to the Company were to exceed 2.5 percent, this would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the Company is subject. For USBNA, the buffer requirement consists of the static capital conservation buffer equal to 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets.\n\nBanking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, and certain discretionary executive compensation, with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and \u201celigible retained income\u201d (defined as the greater of (i) net income for the four preceding quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income; and (ii) the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters).\n\nUnited States banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier | leverage ratio of 4.0 percent. As a Category III banking organization, the Company is also subject to a minimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (\u201cSLR\u201d) of 3.0 percent that takes into account both on-balance sheet and certain off- balance sheet exposures. At December 31, 2023, the Company exceeded the applicable minimum tier 1 leverage ratio and SLR requirements.",

        "text": "In July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities proposed a rule implementing the Basel Committee\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis regulatory capital reforms, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III Endgame.\u201d The proposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective date, subject to a three-year transition period. The proposal would set stricter criteria for the use of internal models by replacing the market risk rule with the \u201cFundamental Review of the Trading Book,\u201d and would introduce new standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk, which would replace the current models-based approaches. In addition, under the proposed rule, also subject to a phase-in period, Category III banking institutions, such as the Company, would no longer be permitted to opt out of including certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital, which would result in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities being included in the calculation of the Company\u2019s regulatory capital ratios. The Company continues to evaluate the potential effects of the proposed rule, and the effects on the Company will depend on the final form of any rulemaking. However, the Company expects that any final rule would result in the Company being required to maintain increased levels of regulatory capital.\n\nIn 2020, the United States federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations, including the Company and USBNA, to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard (\u201c\u201cCECL\u201d) on regulatory capital until January 2022 and subsequently to phase in the effects through January 2025. Through the 2023 stress test cycle, the Federal Reserve has not yet incorporated CECL into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests, and the Federal Reserve issued guidance in December 2023 to indicate that it will maintain the current framework for allowance for credit losses in the supervisory stress test through the 2024 stress test cycle. For further discussion of CECL, see Notes | and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report. The Company and USBNA elected to delay and subsequently phase in the regulatory capital impact of CECL in accordance with this rule.\n\nFor additional information regarding the Company\u2019s regulatory capital, see \u201cCapital Management\u201d in the 2023 Annual Report.\n\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review As required by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (\u201cCCAR\u201d) rules, the Company submits a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis. As part of the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve evaluates the Company\u2019s plans to make capital distributions, including by repurchasing stock or making dividend payments, under a number of macroeconomic and Company-specific assumptions based on the Company\u2019s and the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests described under \u201cStress Testing\u201d below. These capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements, including an assessment of a company\u2019s sources and uses of capital over a nine-quarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions; a detailed description of a company\u2019s process for assessing capital adequacy; and a demonstration of a company\u2019s ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio (without taking the buffers into account) under expected and stressful conditions.",

        "text": "Stress Testing The Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR framework and the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing framework require BHCs subject to Category III standards such as the Company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial company-run stress tests, and subject such BHCs to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve. Among other things, the company-run stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the Company as well as stress scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and incorporate the Dodd-Frank Act capital actions (as opposed to the Company\u2019s planned capital actions), which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large U.S. BHCs. The Federal Reserve conducts CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models and incorporates the Company\u2019s planned capital actions and the Dodd-Frank Act capital actions, respectively, into its stress tests. The Federal Reserve and the Company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial company-run stress tests, respectively, no later than June 30 of each applicable year. If the Company were to become a \u201cCategory II\u201d institution for purposes of the Tailoring Rules, the Company would become subject to annual (rather than biennial) company-run stress tests.\n\nUnder the OCC\u2019s rules, national banks with assets in excess of $250 billion, including USBNA, are required to submit company-run stress test results to the OCC concurrently with their parent BHC\u2019s CCAR submission to the Federal Reserve. The stress test is based on the OCC\u2019s stress scenarios (which are typically the same as the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress scenarios) and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario.\n\nBasel III Liquidity Requirements As Category III banking organizations, the Company and USBNA are each subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (\"LCR\") under the Tailoring Rules. The LCR is designed to ensure that BHCs have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for 30 calendar days. In addition, the Company and USBNA are subject to the net stable funding ratio (\"NSFR\") rule, which is designed to promote stable, longer-term funding of assets and business activities over a one-year time horizon. Under the Tailoring Rules and NSFR rule, the Company and USBNA, as Category III banking organizations with less than $75 billion of weighted short-term wholesale funding, qualify for reduced LCR and NSFR requirements calibrated at 85 percent of the full requirements. If the Company were to become a \u201cCategory II\u201d institution for purposes of the Tailoring Rules, the Company would become subject to the full (100 percent) LCR and NSFR requirements, as well as daily (rather than monthly) liquidity reporting requirements.",

        "text": "Prompt Corrective Action The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (\u201cFDICIA\u201d) provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates (including parent holding companies) by federal banking regulators. As part of that framework, the FDICIA requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d with respect to an FDIC-insured depository institution, such as USBNA, if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. Supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d rules generally depend upon an institution\u2019s classification within five capital categories. An institution that fails to remain well-capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. The FDICIA also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions, including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution.\n\nPrompt corrective action regulations apply only to banks and not to BHCs such as the Company. However, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based on the undercapitalized status of the BHC\u2019s subsidiary banking institutions. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized bank, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary\u2019s capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments.\n\nLong-Term Debt Requirements In August 2023, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued a proposed rule that would require, among other institutions, each Category III U.S. BHC, including the Company, and each insured depository institution with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets that is a consolidated subsidiary of a Category III U.S. BHC, such as USBNA, to have minimum levels of outstanding long-term debt. The proposed rule is intended to improve the resolvability of the banking organizations covered by the rule. Under the proposed rule, covered banking organizations would be required to maintain long-term debt in an amount that is equal to the greater of (i) 6% of the organization\u2019s risk-weighted\n\n10\n\nassets; (ii) 3.5% of the organization\u2019s average total consolidated assets; and (iii) 2.5% of the organization\u2019s total leverage exposure, if the organization is subject to the SLR rule. The requirement would be phased in over three years, with covered banking organizations being required to meet 25% of the requirement within one year after finalization of the rule, 50% after two years and 100% after three years. The Company continues to evaluate the potential effects of the proposed rule. Although any effects on the Company and USBNA will depend on the final form of any rulemaking, the Company expects that under any final tule, it and USBNA would be required to maintain substantially more long-term debt than it currently maintains.\n\nDeposit Insurance The DIF provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor. Deposits at USBNA are insured up to the applicable limits. The DIF is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions, including USBNA, based on the risk each institution poses to the DIF. The FDIC may increase USBNA\u2019s insurance premiums based on various factors, including the FDIC\u2019s assessment of its risk profile.\n\nIn addition, large insured depository institutions, including USBNA, are subject to enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system requirements meant to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail.",

        "text": "In October 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules for all insured depository institutions by two basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The increased assessment rate is intended to improve the likelihood that the DIF reserve ratio would reach the required minimum of 1.35 percent by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2028.\n\nIn November 2023, the FDIC released a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover the losses to the DIF resulting from failures of other banking institutions during 2023. The Company expects the special assessments will be tax deductible. As a result of this rule, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized additional noninterest expense of $734 million for the FDIC special assessment.\n\nDepositor Preference Under federal law, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of a receiver the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in non-domestic offices. As a result, those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution.\n\nOrderly Liquidation Authority Upon the insolvency of a BHC, such as the Company, the FDIC may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the BHC the Secretary of the Treasury determines (upon the written recommendation of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve and after consultation with the President of the United States) that certain conditions set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of a financial company\u2019s failure have been met. FDIC rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company. Acting as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of a BHC without the approval of its creditors.\n\nResolution Plans The Company is required by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the Company and its significant legal entities in the event of future material financial distress or failure. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and such deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose on the Company more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the Company\u2019s growth, activities or operations. If the Company were to fail to address the deficiencies in its resolution plan when required, it could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations. As a Category III banking organization, the Company is required to submit resolution plans on a triennial cycle (alternating between targeted and full submissions). The Company submitted its targeted resolution plan in December 2021 and is scheduled to file its next full resolution plan in July 2024. In addition, in connection with the MUB acquisition, the Company committed to the Federal Reserve that it would, within six months of completing the acquisition of MUB, provide the Federal Reserve and the FDIC with an interim update to its resolution plan. The Company submitted the update to its resolution plan within the required time period.",

In June 2021, the FDIC issued a Statement on Resolution Plans for Insured Depository Institutions (the \u201cFDIC Statement\u201d). Among other things, the FDIC Statement established a three-year filing cycle for banks with $100 billion or more in total assets and provided details regarding the content that filers will be expected to prepare. Under this filing cycle, USBNA submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC in November 2022. In August 2023, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would require insured depository institutions with $100 billion or more in total assets, such as USBNA, to submit biennial resolution plans that include a comprehensive strategy from the point of potential failure to liquidation, which would be required to ensure timely access to insured deposits, maximize value from the disposition of assets, minimize losses to creditors and address potential risks to the U.S. economy or financial stability. Under the proposed rule, USBNA would be required to file resolution plans biennially beginning in 2025. The effects of the proposed rule on USBNA, including the timing of submission, will depend on the final form of any rulemaking.\n\nIn addition, in connection with the approval by the OCC of the merger of MUB into USBNA, USBNA committed (the \u201cOCC Commitments\u201d) to the OCC that it would (i) develop a list of business lines and/or portfolios (each an \u201cobject of sale\u201d) that could be sold quickly in the event of stress; and (ii) prepare a plan, including a timeline, to effectuate such separability, including through the establishment of \u201cdata rooms\u201d for each object of sale. USBNA was required to submit these items to the OCC for a written determination of no supervisory objection within six months of consummation of the merger of MUB into USBNA. USBNA submitted all items within the required timeframe.\n\nRecovery Plans The OCC has established enforceable guidelines for recovery planning by insured national banks with average total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, including USBNA. The guidelines provide that a covered bank should develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its individual risk profile, size, activities, and complexity, including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure. The guidelines state that a recovery plan should, among other elements, (i) establish triggers, which are quantitative or qualitative indicators of the risk or existence of severe stress that should always be escalated to management or the board of directors, as appropriate, for purposes of initiating a response; (ii) identify a wide range of credible options that a covered bank could undertake to restore financial and operational strength and viability; and (iii) address escalation procedures, management reports, and communication procedures. USBNA\u2019s recovery plan was reviewed and approved pursuant to these guidelines in December 2023.",

Under the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regulation W, USBNA and its subsidiaries are subject to quantitative and qualitative limits on extensions of credit (including credit exposure arising from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions), purchases of assets, and certain other transactions with the Company or its other non-bank subsidiaries and affiliates. Additionally, transactions between USBNA or its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or its other non- bank subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other hand, are required to be on arm\u2019s length terms. Transactions between USBNA and its affiliates and the Company and its other non-bank subsidiaries and its affiliates must be consistent with standards of safety and soundness.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering and Sanctions The Company is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and to restrict transactions with persons, companies, or foreign governments sanctioned by United States authorities. This category of laws includes the Bank Secrecy Act (the \u201cBSA\u201d), the Money Laundering Control Act, the USA PATRIOT Act (collectively, \u201cAML laws\u201d), and implementing regulations for the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act, as administered by the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office Foreign Assets Control (\u201csanctions laws\u201d).\n\nAs implemented by federal banking and securities regulators and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, AML laws obligate depository institutions and broker-dealers to verify their customers\u2019 identity, verify the identity of beneficial owners of legal entity customers, conduct customer due diligence, report on suspicious activity, file reports of certain transactions in currency, and conduct enhanced due diligence on certain accounts. Sanctions laws prohibit United States persons and certain foreign affiliates from engaging in any transaction with a restricted person or restricted country. Depository institutions and broker- dealers are required by their respective federal regulators to maintain policies and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the above obligations. Federal regulators regularly examine BSA/Anti-Money Laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) and sanctions compliance programs to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, and the frequency and extent of such examinations and related remedial actions have been increasing.\n\nIn January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (\u201cAMLA\u201d), which amends the BSA, was enacted. Among other things, the AMLA codified a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions;\n\n12",

Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance. In June 2021, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under the AMLA. The priorities include corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing.\n\nCommunity Reinvestment Act USBNA is subject to the provisions of the CRA. Under the terms of the CRA, banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including providing credit to individuals residing in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The OCC assesses USBNA on its record in meeting the credit needs of the community served by USBNA, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. CRA assessments also are considered by the Federal Reserve or OCC when reviewing applications by banking institutions to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, or to relocate an office. In the case of a BHC applying for approval to acquire a bank or other BHC, the Federal Reserve will assess the CRA records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant BHC, and those records may be the basis for denying the application. USBNA received an \u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its most recent examination, covering the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2020. Prior to merging into USBNA, MUB received an \u201cOutstanding\u201d CRA rating in its most recent examination, covering the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018.\n\nIn October 2023, the OCC, together with the Federal Reserve and FDIC, issued a final rule to modernize the CRA regulatory framework. The final rule is intended, among other things, to strengthen the achievement of the core purpose of the CRA, to adapt to changes in the banking industry, including the expanded role of mobile and online banking, and to tailor performance standards to account for differences in bank size and business models. The final rule tracks the proposed rule issued by the agencies in May 2022 and adjusts CRA evaluations based on bank size and type, with many of the changes applying only to banks with over $2 billion in assets and several applying only to banks with over $10 billion in assets, such as USBNA. The final rule introduces major changes to the CRA regulatory framework: (i) the delineation of assessment areas; (ii) the overall evaluation framework and performance standards and metrics; (iii) the definition of community development activities; and (iv) data collection and reporting. The final rule will become effective on April 1, 2024, but most provisions of the rule will not become applicable until January 1, 2026. The Company continues to evaluate the effect of the final rule on USBNA, and any effects may depend on further guidance from the regulators with respect to interpretive and implementation-related issues that may arise.",

        "text": "Regulation of Brokerage, Investment Advisory and Insurance Activities The Company conducts a broad range of securities activities, both retail and institutional, in the United States through U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., PFM Fund Distributors, Inc. and U.S. Bancorp Advisors, LLC (collectively, \u201cbroker- dealer entities\u201d). These activities are subject to regulations of the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and other authorities, including state regulators. These regulations generally cover licensing of securities personnel, interactions with customers and counterparties, trading operations, securities underwriting compensation and arrangements, customer suitability, recordkeeping, reporting and communications. Securities regulators impose capital requirements on the Company\u2019s broker-dealer entities and conduct audits or other periodic reviews of their sales practice and financial operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s broker-dealer entities are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which oversees the liquidation of member broker-dealers that close when the broker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial distress and imposes membership fee assessments and other reporting requirements on the broker- dealer entities.\n\nThe operations of the First American family of funds, the Company\u2019s proprietary money market fund complex, also are subject to regulation by the SEC, including rules requiring a floating net asset value for institutional prime and tax-free money market funds and permitting the board of directors of the money market funds the ability to limit redemptions during periods of stress (allowing for the use of liquidity fees and redemption gates during such times). In July 2023, the SEC finalized amendments to the rules that govern money market funds. These amendments will, among other things, increase liquidity requirements for money market funds by requiring funds to hold greater proportions of their total assets in securities that can be liquidated in one business day, and will require institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt money market funds to impose liquidity fees on investors that redeem their investments during times of stress.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations in the areas of insurance brokerage and reinsurance of credit life insurance are subject to regulation and supervision by various state insurance regulatory authorities, including the licensing of insurance brokers and agents.\n\n13\n\nRegulation of Derivatives and the Swaps Marketplace Under the Dodd-Frank Act, USBNA, as a CFTC registered swap dealer, is subject to rules regarding the regulation of the swaps marketplace and over-the-counter derivatives, including rules that require swap dealers and major swap participants to register with the CFTC, to meet robust business conduct standards to lower risk and promote market integrity, to meet certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements so that regulators can better monitor the markets, to centrally clear and trade swaps on regulated exchanges or execution facilities, and to be subject to certain capital and margin requirements. CFTC rules also require USBNA to be a member of the National Futures Association, a self-regulatory organization with authority over swap dealers.\n\nIn addition, the OCC\u2019s rules concerning swap margin and capital requirements for swap dealers regulated by the OCC mandate the exchange of initial and variation margin for non-cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps between swap entities regulated by five federal agencies and certain counterparties. The amount of margin will vary based on the relative risk of the non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap. Other rules generally exempt inter-affiliate transactions from initial margin requirements to the extent a depository institution\u2019s total exposure to all affiliates is less than 15 percent of its tier 1 capital.",

        "text": "The Volcker Rule Section 13 of the BHC Act and its implementing regulations, commonly referred to as the \u201cVolcker Rule,\u201d prohibit banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading, and prohibit certain interests in, or relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule applies to the Company, USBNA and their affiliates, and compliance requirements are tailored based on the size and scope of trading activities. The Company has a Volcker Rule compliance program in place that covers all of its subsidiaries and affiliates, including USBNA.\n\nPrivacy and Data Protection Federal and state laws contain extensive consumer privacy and data protection provisions. The Gramm Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing nonpublic personal information and enables retail customers to opt out of the sharing of such information with nonaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances. Other federal and state laws and regulations impact the Company\u2019s ability to share certain information with affiliates and non-affiliates for marketing and/or non-marketing purposes, or to contact customers with marketing offers. The GLBA also requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program. Security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all the Company\u2019s businesses and geographic locations.\n\nData privacy and data protection are areas of increasing legislative focus in the United States, and several U.S. states have enacted comprehensive consumer privacy laws that impose compliance obligations with respect to personal information. The Company has made and will make operational adjustments in accordance with the requirements of applicable privacy and data protection laws. For example, the Company is subject to the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 and its implementing regulations, as amended in 2020 by the California Privacy Rights Act (the \"CCPA\"), which provided residents of California with specific rights with respect to the collection of their personal information. The process of drafting and finalizing implementing regulations for the CCPA is ongoing. The Company continues to evaluate the new regulations, and the effects on the Company will depend on the form of any additional rulemakings.\n\nSimilar comprehensive consumer privacy laws have been adopted by other states where the Company does business. Each of these state laws, however, includes an entity level exemption for \u201cfinancial institutions\u201d that are subject to the GLBA like the Company. The United States Congress has also proposed legislation relating to data privacy and data protection, and the federal government may in the future pass such legislation.\n\nIn addition, in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), privacy law is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which is directly binding and applicable in each EU member state. The GDPR contains enhanced compliance obligations and increased penalties for non-compliance compared to the prior law governing data privacy in the EU and is regularly enforced by European regulators. Canada is in the process of replacing its federal privacy law, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, with a new privacy framework that the Company expects will impose additional compliance obligations on the Company\u2019s Canadian operations.",

        "text": "In October 2023, the CFPB issued a proposed rule regarding personal financial data rights that would apply to financial institutions that offer consumer deposit accounts and credit card issuers. Under the proposed rule, USBNA would be required to provide consumers and their authorized third parties electronic access to 24 months of transaction data, certain account information, account balance, upcoming bill information, information to initiate payment to and from accounts, and the terms and conditions under which an account or credit card was provided. USBNA would be prohibited from imposing any fees or charges for maintaining or providing access to such data. USBNA would also be obligated to comply with data accuracy, retention and other requirements contained in the proposed rule. The Company continues to evaluate the proposed rule, and the impact on USBNA and the Company will depend on the final form of any rulemaking.\n\nLike other lenders, USBNA and other subsidiaries of the Company use consumer reports in their underwriting activities. Use of such information is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), and the FCRA also regulates\n\n14\n\nreporting information to consumer reporting agencies, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of consumer reports between affiliates, and using affiliate credit data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the Company and its subsidiaries. A significant overhaul of the FCRA is expected to be issued in the first half of 2024, which will impact USBNA and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe federal banking regulators, as well as the SEC, CFPB, CFTC, and related self-regulatory organizations, regularly issue guidance on cybersecurity that is intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions. A financial institution\u2019s management is required to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution\u2019s operations after a cybersecurity incident. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if the institution or its critical service providers experience a cybersecurity incident.\n\nIn November 2021, the United States federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer-security incidents. Under the final rule, which was effective April 1, 2022, a banking organization, such as the Company and USBNA, is required to notify their primary federal regulator within 36 hours of a computer-security incident that results in actual harm to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system or the information that the system processes, stores or transmits, which has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization\u2019s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. Similarly, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada requires Federally Regulated Financial Institutions to report qualifying technology and cybersecurity incidents under the provisions of the August 13, 2021 Technology and Cyber Security Incident Reporting Advisory.",

        "text": "Consumer Protection USBNA\u2019s retail banking activities are subject to a variety of federal and state statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations require, among other things, disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices and subject USBNA to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys\u2019 fees, and may also result in significant reputational harm. USBNA\u2019s regulators may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions and civil money penalties.\n\nUSBNA and its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer laws. The CFPB has undertaken numerous rule-making and other initiatives, including launching an initiative to reduce the amounts and types of fees financial institutions may charge, including by recently proposing a rule that would significantly reduce the permissible amount of credit card late fees, issuing informal guidance and taking enforcement actions against certain financial institutions. The CFPB\u2019s rulemaking, examination and enforcement authority has affected and will continue to affect financial institutions that provide consumer financial products and services, including the Company, USBNA and the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries. These regulatory activities may limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, which in turn may reduce the Company\u2019s revenues.\n\nExecutive and Incentive Compensation Guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as \u201cexcessive\u201d when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. The Federal Reserve has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies (the \u201cIncentive Compensation Guidance\u201d) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine safety and soundness organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Incentive Compensation Guidance is based upon the key principles that a banking organization\u2019s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization\u2019s ability to effectively identify and manage risks; (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization\u2019s board of directors. The Incentive Compensation Guidance states that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.\n\nDuring 2016, the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion of total assets. These proposed rules have not been finalized.\n\nIn October 2022, the SEC adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations, including the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), to implement listing standards that require all listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or \u201cclawback\u201d of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive",

In this model, specific to cybersecurity threats, the first line of defense is Information Security Services (ISS), which is responsible for identifying and implementing cybersecurity controls in accordance with policy requirements and industry best practices, to meet regulatory requirements and to safeguard the business. The second line of defense, Cybersecurity Risk Oversight within the Company's Operational Risk Management group, provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks related to cybersecurity and other concerns to senior management, the ERC, the ISRC, other designated senior operating committees, and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.

At the first level, the ISS team identifies, assesses, and manages cybersecurity risk and threats. The Company manages cybersecurity issues and findings through remediation and/or closure, with escalation processes if an issue or finding cannot be remediated within required timeframes. The Company engages external assessors, consultants, and auditors to review the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risk program against those of industry peers. The Company also uses consultants periodically to provide recommendations to improve and enhance the program. Additionally, the Company continually works to align its policies and practices with industry-accepted information security practices as provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), and other applicable standards, laws, and regulations.\n\nThe Company also maintains a third-party risk management program responsible for the oversight of outsourced operations, which enables the Company to oversee and identify risks related to engaging third-party service providers, including risks from cybersecurity threats to third-party service providers.

The Company also obtains contractual assurances from third-party service providers relating to their security responsibilities, controls, reporting, and roles and responsibilities as it pertains to cybersecurity incident response policies and notification requirements. As appropriate, the Company obtains independent reviews of the third parties\u2019 security through audit reports and testing and conducts verification and validation with third parties to confirm cybersecurity and information security risks are appropriately identified, measured, mitigated, monitored, and reported by the third party to the Company.",

The Board carries out its risk management oversight responsibilities primarily through its committees. Each Board committee is responsible for overseeing certain risks under its charter. The Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee, with support from its Cybersecurity and Technology Subcommittee, has primary oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risk, including risks from any cybersecurity threats. The Risk Management Committee monitors the Company\u2019s compliance with the risk management framework and risk limits established under the Company\u2019s risk appetite statement approved by the Board. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the Company\u2019s independent risk management function. The Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee has a Cybersecurity and Technology Subcommittee that provides dedicated oversight to\n\n18\n\ncybersecurity risk management and cyber resiliency and certain technology matters. The Risk Management Committee and its Cybersecurity and Technology Subcommittee receive quarterly reports from management on cybersecurity issues, including cybersecurity threats. The Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee and Audit Committee also hold a joint meeting annually at which they receive a report from the Company\u2019s CISO on cybersecurity threats facing the Company and its preparedness to meet and respond to those threats. In addition, the full Board typically holds an annual cybersecurity education session, which features the perspective of an outside expert on current cybersecurity topics. The Company also typically conducts an annual executive-level cybersecurity exercise to test its cyber incident response, completeness of playbooks, and communication protocols. This exercise involves Board members, managing committee members, third-party companies, and regulators as appropriate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework includes its risk appetite statement, which is approved annually by the Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee and defines acceptable levels of risk-taking and risk limits and establishes the governance and oversight activities over risk management and reporting. Management monitors and measures the Company\u2019s risk appetite using a quantitative risk scorecard, which consists of risk appetite metrics and associated limits reported to the Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis. The Company\u2019s risk appetite statement includes specific information security metrics and associated limits. These limits also inform how matters, including cybersecurity incidents or threats, are escalated to specific members of management, appropriate senior operating committee (including the ISRC and/or ERC), and/or the Board of Directors or appropriate Board committee. The Board\u2019s Risk Management Committee oversees the Company\u2019s risk profile relative to its risk appetite and compliance with risk limits.\n\nThe members of the Company\u2019s management that are primarily responsible for assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity threats, including monitoring risk appetite metrics and limits related to cybersecurity, include the Company\u2019s CISO, Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Information and Technology Officer.",

        "text": "The Company\u2019s CISO is primarily responsible for the implementation of defense capabilities and risk mitigation strategies. The Company\u2019s CISO, Timothy J. Held, has over 26 years of information technology and cybersecurity experience. He holds the title of Executive Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer and has been in his role since 2018, having served as the Company\u2019s Deputy CISO from 2015 to 2018 and Head of Cyber Defense, Threat Intelligence, and Incident Response from 2012 to 2018. The CISO is supported by his direct reports and their teams, many of whom hold cybersecurity-related certifications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s CISO reports to the Vice Chair and Chief Risk Officer, Jodi L. Richard, who has served in that position since October 2018. She served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operational Risk Officer of the Company from January 2018 until October 2018, having served as Senior Vice President and Chief Operational Risk Officer from 2014 until January 2018. Prior to that time, Ms. Richard held various senior leadership roles at HSBC from 2003 until 2014, including Executive Vice President and Head of Operational Risk and Internal Control at HSBC North America from 2008 to 2014.\n\nVenkatachari Dilip, the Company\u2019s Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Information and Technology Officer, has oversight of technology-related risk management issues and controls that align to the NIST CSF. Mr. Dilip previously was an Executive Vice President from September 2018 to April 2023 and has served as Chief Information and Technology Officer since joining the Company in September 2018. From May 2014 until July 2017, he served as Vice President at McKinsey Digital where he helped banks accelerate their digital transformation. From April 2009 to September 2013, he served as CEO at Compass Labs leading an innovative marketing analytics company. From March 2006 until April 2008, he served as Director of Products at Google where he led product teams for mobile ads and Google Checkout. From March 2004 until March 2006, he served as Vice President of PayPal/eBay and on the Board of PayPal Europe, where he was responsible for Payments Services, Risk and Fraud Management. Previously, Mr. Dilip co-founded and led startup companies CashEdge and CommerceSoft from 1996 until 2003.\n\nThe CISO and his leadership team generally meet each business day to discuss security item triage and emerging threats and trends identified by the Threat Intelligence Team. The CISO shares pertinent information from those meetings with the Chief Risk Officer. During a cyber incident, which could involve the Company or a third-party service provider to the Company, the Company\u2019s Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) leads the response and internal communication. CSIRT manages low and moderate severity incidents, and Enterprise Crisis Management manages high and very high severity incidents. The risk rating of an incident may change throughout the incident investigation period as new information is learned or the environment changes. Depending on severity level, CSIRT or Enterprise Crisis Management distributes incident communications to senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Board of Directors or appropriate Board committee, and if applicable, the Company\u2019s regulators.\n\nISS leadership reports prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation activities through various working groups and committees. Certain working groups meet with the CISO monthly to review completed risk assessments, and items that require escalation are reported up using the internal committee structure and ad hoc communications if time sensitive.\n\n19",

If notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been duly given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by USB for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, on and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price.\n\nIn case of any redemption of only part of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata or in such other manner as USB may determine to be fair and equitable.\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s risk-based capital guidelines applicable to bank holding companies, any redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nRights Upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up \u2014 In the event of USB\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time\n\noutstanding will be entitled to receive a liquidating distribution in the amount of the liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, plus any authorized, declared and unpaid dividends for the then-current dividend period to the date of liquidation, out of USB\u2019s assets legally available for distribution to USB\u2019s stockholders, before any distribution is made to holders of USB\u2019s Common Stock or any Junior Stock and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of securities ranking senior to or on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock upon liquidation and the rights of USB\u2019s depositors and other creditors.",

As a result, certain holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may become subject to regulations under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBank Holding Company Act\u201d) and/or certain acquisitions of the Series A Preferred Stock may be subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nSo long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding:\n\n* the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock at the time outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, will be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon USB\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up; and\n\n* the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, voting separately as a class, will be required to amend the provisions of USB\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation or the Certificate of Designations of the Series A Preferred Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock so as to materially and adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the\n\nSeries A Preferred Stock, taken as a whole; provided, however, that any increase in the amount of the authorized or issued Series A Preferred Stock or authorized Preferred Stock or the creation and issuance, or an increase in the authorized or issued amount, of other series of Preferred Stock and/or Junior Stock will not be deemed to adversely affect the powers, preferences, privileges or rights of the Series A Preferred Stock.",

Holders of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by USB\u2019s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board, out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends payable quarterly in arrears on each January 15, April 15, July 15 or October 15 (or, if such day is not a business day, the next business day). Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (1) three-month LIBOR? (computed as provided below) plus 0.60% or (2) 3.50%. In the case that any date on which dividends are payable on the Series B Preferred Stock is not a business day, then payment of the dividend payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a business day. However, no interest or other payment will be paid in respect of the delay. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will be the last day of the immediately preceding calendar month during which the dividend payment date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any dividend period will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the number of days actually elapsed. For purposes of the Series B Preferred Stock, the term \u201cbusiness day\u201d means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in New York, New York.\n\nFor any dividend period, three-month LIBOR will be determined by the calculation agent on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period in the following manner:\n\nFollowing the cessation of representative three-month LIBOR, after June 30, 2023, this three-month LIBOR rate transitioned to three-month CME Term SOFR plus a tenor spread adjustment of 0.26161% in accordance with the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule.\n\n?\n\n11\n\nbe\n\nThree-month LIBOR will be the offered rate per annum for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day such period, as that rate appears on Moneyline Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period.\n\nIf the rate described above does not appear on Moneyline Telerate page 3750, three-month LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates, at approximately 11:00 A.M., London time, on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, at which deposits of the following kind are offered to prime banks in the London interbank market by four major banks in that market selected by USB: three-month deposits in U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000. The calculation agent will request the principal London office of each of these banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two quotations are provided, three- month LIBOR for the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations.\n\nIf fewer than two quotations are provided as described above, three-month LIBOR for the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates for loans of the following kind to leading European banks quoted, at approximately 11:00 A.M. New York City time on the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first day of such dividend period, by three major banks in New York City selected by USB: three-month loans of U.S. dollars, beginning on the first day of such dividend period, and in a principal amount of not less than $1,000,000.",

In that event, the number of directors on USB\u2019s board of directors will automatically increase by two and, at the request of any holder of Series B Preferred Stock, a special meeting of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock that ranks on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, will be called for the election of the two directors (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election will be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), followed by such election at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until full dividends have been paid regularly on the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock that ranks on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends for at least four consecutive dividend periods following the Nonpayment.\n\nIf and when full dividends have been regularly paid for at least four consecutive dividend periods following a Nonpayment on the Series B Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Parity Stock, the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and the term of office of each Preferred Director so elected will terminate and the number of directors on USB\u2019s board of directors will automatically decrease by two. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock (together with holders of any and all other classes of USB\u2019s authorized Preferred Stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such Preferred Stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment continues, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock (together with holders of any and all other class of USB\u2019s authorized Preferred Stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such Preferred Stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders.

The record date for payment of dividends on the Series J Preferred Stock will be the last day of the immediately preceding calendar month during which the dividend payment date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any period prior to April 15, 2027 will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and dividends for periods thereafter will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. For purposes of the Series J Preferred Stock, the term \u201cbusiness day\u201d means, for dividend periods prior to April 15, 2027, each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in New York, New York, and for dividend periods on and after April 15, 2027, it means any date that would be considered a Business Day for dividend periods prior to April 15, 2027 that is also a London Banking Day.

Holders of Series L Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by USB\u2019s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board, out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends. Dividends on each share of Series L Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 3.75% payable quarterly in arrears on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15. If any day on which dividends are payable on the Series L Preferred Stock is not a business day, then payment of the dividend payable on that date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a business day, without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series L Preferred Stock will be the last day of the immediately preceding calendar month during which the dividend payment date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. For purposes of the Series L Preferred Stock, the term \u201cbusiness day\u201d means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in New York, New York. Dividends on the Series L Preferred Stock will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause USB to fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.\n\nThe right of holders of the Series L Preferred Stock to receive dividends is non-cumulative. If USB\u2019s board of directors does not declare a dividend on the Series L Preferred Stock or declares less than a full dividend in respect of any dividend period, the holders of the Series L Preferred Stock will have no right to receive any dividend or a full dividend, as the case may be, for that dividend period, and USB will have no obligation to pay a dividend or to pay full dividends for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared and paid for any future dividend period with respect to the Series L Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of USB\u2019s authorized Preferred Stock.\n\nWhen dividends are not paid in full upon the Series L Preferred Stock and any other Parity Stock, dividends upon that stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the current dividend period per share on the Series L Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on such Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series L Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.\n\nRedemption \u2014The Series L Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provision.\n\n30\n\nThe Series L Preferred Stock will be redeemable at USB\u2019s option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after January 15, 2026 at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.",

Holders of Series M Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by USB\u2019s board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board, out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends under Delaware law, non-cumulative cash dividends. Dividends on each share of Series M Preferred Stock will accrue on the liquidation preference amount of $25,000 per share at a rate per annum equal to 4.00% payable quarterly in arrears on each January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15. If any day on which dividends are payable on the Series M Preferred Stock is not a business day, then payment of the dividend payable on that\n\n35\n\ndate will be made on the next succeeding day that is a business day, without any interest or other payment in respect of such delay. The record date for payment of dividends on the Series M Preferred Stock will be the last day of the immediately preceding calendar month during which the dividend payment date falls. The amount of dividends payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to three decimal places, with $0.0005 being rounded upward. For purposes of the Series M Preferred Stock, the term \u201cbusiness day\u201d means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in New York, New York. Dividends on the Series M Preferred Stock will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause USB to fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.\n\nThe right of holders of the Series M Preferred Stock to receive dividends is non-cumulative. If USB\u2019s board of directors does not declare a dividend on the Series M Preferred Stock or declares less than a full dividend in respect of any dividend period, the holders of the Series M Preferred Stock will have no right to receive any dividend or a full dividend, as the case may be, for that dividend period, and USB will have no obligation to pay a dividend or to pay full dividends for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared and paid for any future dividend period with respect to the Series M Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of USB\u2019s authorized Preferred Stock.\n\nWhen dividends are not paid in full upon the Series M Preferred Stock and any other Parity Stock, dividends upon that stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the current dividend period per share on the Series M Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on such Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series M Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.\n\nRedemption \u2014The Series M Preferred Stock is not subject to any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provision.",

In that event, the number of directors on USB\u2019s board of directors will automatically increase by two and, at the request of any holder of Series M Preferred Stock, a special meeting of the holders of Series M Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock that ranks on parity with the Series M Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends and for which dividends have not been paid, will be called for the election of the two directors (unless such request is received less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of the stockholders, in which event such election will be held at such next annual or special meeting of stockholders), followed by such election at each subsequent annual meeting. These voting rights will continue until full dividends have been paid regularly on the shares of the Series M Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock that ranks on parity with the Series M Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent following the Nonpayment.\n\n38\n\nIf and when full dividends have been regularly paid for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent following a Nonpayment on the Series M Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Parity Stock, the holders of the Series M Preferred Stock will be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and the term of office of each Preferred Director so elected will terminate and the number of directors on USB\u2019s board of directors will automatically decrease by two. Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time without cause by the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series M Preferred Stock (together with holders of any and all other classes of USB\u2019s authorized Preferred Stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such Preferred Stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) when they have the voting rights described above. So long as a Nonpayment continues, any vacancy in the office of a Preferred Director (other than prior to the initial election of the Preferred Directors) may be filled by the written consent of the Preferred Director remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of Series M Preferred Stock (together with holders of any and all other class of USB\u2019s authorized Preferred Stock having equivalent voting rights, whether or not the holders of such Preferred Stock would be entitled to vote for the election of directors if such default in dividends did not exist) to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders. The Preferred Directors will each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.",

If USB\u2019s board of directors does not declare a dividend on the Series N Preferred Stock or declares less than a full dividend in respect of any dividend period, the holders of the Series N Preferred Stock will have no right to receive any dividend or a full dividend, as the case may be, for that dividend period, and USB will have no obligation to pay a dividend or to pay full dividends for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared and paid for any future dividend period with respect to the Series N Preferred Stock, Parity Stock, Junior Stock or any other class or series of USB\u2019s authorized Preferred Stock.\n\n43\n\nWhen dividends are not paid in full upon the Series N Preferred Stock and any other Parity Stock, dividends upon that stock will be declared on a proportional basis so that the amount of dividends declared per share will bear to each other the same ratio that accrued dividends for the current dividend period per share on the Series N Preferred Stock, and accrued dividends, including any accumulations, on such Parity Stock, bear to each other. No interest will be payable in respect of any dividend payment on the Series N Preferred Stock that may be in arrears.",

If notice of redemption of any shares of Series N Preferred Stock has been duly given and if the funds necessary for such redemption have been set aside by USB for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series N Preferred Stock so called for redemption, then, on and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on such shares of Series N Preferred Stock, such shares of Series N Preferred Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price.",

The amount of dividends payable for any period will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dollar amounts resulting from that calculation will be rounded to three decimal places, with $0.0005 being rounded upward. For purposes of the Series O Preferred Stock, the term \u201cbusiness day\u201d means each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday on which banking institutions are not authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to close in New York, New York. Dividends on the Series O Preferred Stock will not be declared, paid or set aside for payment to the extent such act would cause USB to fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, including applicable capital adequacy guidelines.",

These voting rights will continue until full dividends have been paid regularly on the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Preferred Stock that ranks on parity with the Series O Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent following the Nonpayment.\n\nIf and when full dividends have been regularly paid for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent following a Nonpayment on the Series O Preferred Stock and any other class or series of Parity Stock, the holders of the Series O Preferred Stock will be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent Nonpayment) and the term of office of each Preferred Director so elected will terminate and the number of directors on USB\u2019s board of directors will automatically decrease by two.

The Preferred Directors will each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.\n\nIf the holders of Series O Preferred Stock become entitled to vote for the election of Preferred Directors, the Series O Preferred Stock may be considered a class of voting securities under interpretations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. As a result, certain holders of the Series O Preferred Stock may become subject to regulations under the Bank Holding Company Act and/or certain acquisitions of the Series O Preferred Stock may be subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nSo long as any shares of Series O Preferred Stock remain outstanding:\n\n* the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the shares of the Series O Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock at the time outstanding, voting as a single class without regard to series, will be required to issue, authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or to issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to purchase, any class or series of stock ranking senior to the Series O Preferred Stock and all other Parity Stock with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon USB\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up; and\n\n52",

As described above, all of USB\u2019s outstanding series of Preferred Stock were offered as fractional interests in such shares of Preferred Stock in the form of depositary shares. Each depositary share represents a fractional ownership interest in a share of Preferred Stock, and will be evidenced by a depositary receipt. The shares of each series of Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares have been deposited under a deposit agreement among USB, U.S. Bank National Association, as depositary, and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts evidencing the depositary shares. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share will be entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Preferred Stock represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the applicable series of Preferred Stock represented thereby (including dividend, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).\n\nThe depositary will distribute any cash dividends or other cash distributions received in respect of the deposited Preferred Stock to the record holders of depositary shares relating to the underlying Preferred Stock in proportion to the number of depositary shares held by the holders. The depositary will distribute any property received by it other than cash to the record holders of depositary shares entitled to those distributions, unless it determines that the distribution cannot be made proportionally among those holders or that it is not feasible to make a distribution. In\n\n53\n\nthat event, the depositary may, with USB\u2019s approval, sell the property and distribute the net proceeds from the sale to the holders of the depositary shares in proportion to the number of depositary shares they hold. Record dates for the payment of dividends and other matters relating to the depositary shares will be the same as the corresponding record dates for the applicable series of Preferred Stock. The amounts distributed to holders of depositary shares will be reduced by any amounts required to be withheld by the depositary or by USB on account of taxes or other governmental charges.\n\nIf USB redeems any shares of Preferred Stock represented by depositary shares, the corresponding depositary shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the depositary resulting from the redemption of the Preferred Stock held by the depositary. The redemption price per depositary share will be equal to the fraction of the share of Preferred Stock represented by the depositary share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. Whenever USB redeems shares of Preferred Stock held by the depositary, the depositary will redeem, as of the same redemption date, the number of depositary shares representing the shares of Preferred Stock so redeemed. In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding depositary shares, the depositary shares to be redeemed will be selected by the depositary pro rata or in such other manner determined by the depositary to be equitable. In any such case, USB will redeem depositary shares only in increments equal to the denominator of the fraction of the share of Preferred Stock represented by one depositary share.",

These provisions also could discourage, delay or prevent the removal of incumbent directors or the assumption of control by stockholders. USB believes that these provisions are appropriate to protect its interests and USB\u2019s stockholders.\n\n54\n\nRestrictions on Ownership. The Bank Holding Company Act requires a \u201cbank holding company\u201d (as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act) to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring more than five percent (5%) of USB\u2019s outstanding Common Stock. Any person, other than a bank holding company, is required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire ten percent (10%) or more of USB\u2019s outstanding Common Stock under the Change in Bank Control Act. Any holder of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of USB\u2019s outstanding Common Stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation as a bank holding company, under the Bank Holding Company Act.\n\nStockholder Action by Written Consent. USB\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation authorizes action by the stockholders of USB only pursuant to a meeting and not by a written consent.\n\nSpecial Meetings of Stockholders. USB\u2019s Bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by USB\u2019s board of directors, USB\u2019s chief executive officer or by USB\u2019s secretary at the written request (a \u201cSpecial Meeting Request\u2019\u2019) of holders of record of at least 25% of the voting power of the outstanding stock of USB entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting (the \u201cRequisite Percentage\u201d) (such percentage to be based on the number of outstanding voting shares of USB most recently disclosed prior to the date of the request for the special meeting by USB in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d)). A Special Meeting Request must be signed by each stockholder requesting the special meeting (each, a \u201cRequesting Stockholder\u201d) and must be accompanied by a notice setting forth the information specified in USB\u2019s Bylaws. Requesting Stockholders who collectively hold at least the Requisite Percentage on the date the Special Meeting Request is submitted to USB\u2019s secretary must: (i) continue to hold at least the number of shares of stock set forth in the Special Meeting Request with respect to each such Requesting Stockholder through the date of the special meeting; and (ii) submit a written certification (an \u201cOwnership Certification\u201d) confirming the continuation of such holdings on the business day immediately preceding the special meeting, which Ownership Certification must include the information specified in USB\u2019s Bylaws.",

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, if at any time subsequent to the Grant Date the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that Participant has subjected the Company to significant financial, reputational, or other risk by (i) failing to comply with Company policies and procedures, including the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, (ii) violating any law or regulation, (iii) engaging in negligence or willful misconduct, or (iv) engaging in activity resulting in a significant or material control deficiency under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, then all or part of the Units granted under the Agreement that have not been settled (and Shares delivered) at the time of such determination may be cancelled.

As soon as administratively feasible following a Separation From Service in connection with a Qualifying Termination (and in any case no later than 60 days following such Separation From Service except as otherwise provided in this Section 3(b)), all Shares issuable pursuant to Units that become vested in accordance with Section 2(a)(iv) shall be distributed to Participant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Shares issuable to a Specified Employee (as defined in Section 10) as a result of a Separation From Service in connection with a Qualifying Termination will not be delivered to such Specified Employee until the date that is six months and one day after the date of the Separation From Service. If in connection with a Change in Control the Units are adjusted, or units in the acquiring or surviving entity are substituted for the Units, or the Plan is terminated, in each case\n\npermitted under the Plan and in accordance with Section 409A, then the terms of such adjustment, substitution or plan termination will govern the treatment of the Units, including the time and manner of settlement of the Units.",

        "text": "Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis\n\nOverview\n\nU.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) continued to demonstrate financial strength and stability as 2023 financial results showcased solid fee revenue growth, prudent expense management, and the accretion of common equity tier 1 capital of 150 basis points. Disruption in the banking industry in early 2023 reinforced the Company's focus of maintaining a well-diversified business with an appropriate risk profile and diversified deposit base. During 2023, the Company continued to prudently manage its balance sheet by reducing its exposure to certain capital-intensive assets and focusing on capital-efficient growth.\n\nMUFG Union Bank Acquisition On December 1, 2022, the Company acquired MUFG Union Bank N.A.\u2019s core regional banking franchise (\u201cMUB\u201d) from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (\"MUFG\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MUB for a purchase price consisting of $5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of the Company's common stock. The Company also received additional MUB cash of $3.5 billion upon completion of the acquisition, which is required to be repaid to MUFG on or prior to the fifth anniversary date of the completion of the purchase. On August 3, 2023, the Company completed a debt/equity conversion with MUFG. As a result, the Company repaid $936 million of its debt obligation from the proceeds of the issuance of 24 million shares of common stock of the Company to an affiliate of MUFG (the \u201cDebt/Equity Conversion\u201d). After the Debt/Equity Conversion, the Company had a remaining repayment obligation to MUFG of $2.6 billion. On May 26, 2023, the Company merged MUB into U.S. Bank National Association (\"USBNA\"), the Company's primary banking subsidiary. During 2023, the Company successfully completed the integration of the MUB business and system conversion. Additionally, as a condition of the regulatory approval, the Company committed to meet requirements applicable to Category II banking organizations by the earlier of (i) the date required under the federal banking regulators\u2019 Tailoring Rules; and (ii) December 31, 2024, if the Federal Reserve notified the Company by January 1, 2024, that the Company must comply with those requirements. During 2023, the Company took several actions to optimize the balance sheet and reduce risk-weighted assets to enhance capital and reduce the risk profile of the balance sheet. As a result, on October 16, 2023, the Federal Reserve granted the Company full relief from this commitment. The Company\u2019s 2023 results reflect the impacts of balance sheet and capital management actions and the full financial results of the acquired business.\n\nFinancial Performance The Company earned $5.4 billion in 2023, or $3.27 per diluted common share, compared with $5.8 billion, or $3.69 per diluted common share in 2022.\n\n22 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nFinancial performance for 2023, compared with 2022, included the following:\n\n* Net interest income increased $2.7 billion (18.1 percent) due to higher interest rates on earning assets and the MUB acquisition, partially offset by the impact of deposit mix and pricing;\n\n* Noninterest income increased $1.2 billion (12.3 percent) primarily due to higher commercial products revenue, payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and other noninterest income, partially offset by losses on investment securities;\n\n* Noninterest expense increased $4.0 billion (26.6 percent), reflecting increased merger and integration charges and operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, including core deposit intangible amortization expense, as well as increases in compensation and employee benefits expense to support business growth and higher other noninterest expense due to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") special assessment;",

The Company believes it is well positioned to continue to deliver strong returns on tangible common equity, is appropriately reserved for a potential macroeconomic slowdown, and remains confident in its strategy for future growth and expansion. The Company is seeing positive momentum across its fee-based businesses, as it deepens its most profitable client relationships and further executes on revenue growth opportunities resulting from the MUB acquisition. The Company is working to effectively manage its balance sheet for continued capital-efficient growth as it maintains its disciplined, through-the-cycle approach to credit risk management. The Company's growth strategy remains focused on supporting the needs of and creating value for its customers, communities and shareholders.\n\nEarnings Summary The Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of $5.4 billion in 2023, or $3.27 per diluted common share, compared with $5.8 billion, or $3.69 per diluted common share, in 2022. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 0.82 percent and 10.8 percent, respectively, in 2023, compared with 0.98 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively, in 2022. The results for 2023 included the full financial results of the acquisition of MUB, while the results for 2022 reflected one month of operating results of MUB. The results for 2023 included the impacts of $1.0 billion of merger and integration charges, $734 million of FDIC special assessment charges, $243 million of provision for credit losses related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, $140 million of securities losses related to balance sheet repositioning, a $110 million charitable contribution to support a community benefit plan related to the acquisition, and a $70 million discrete tax benefit. Combined, these items decreased 2023 diluted earnings per common share by $1.04. The results for 2022 included $399 million of losses primarily resulting from interest rate economic hedges related to the MUB acquisition, $329 million of merger and integration charges, and $791 million of provision for credit losses related to acquired loans and balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions. Combined, these items decreased 2022 diluted earnings per common share by $0.76.\n\n24 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report",

The increase in net interest income from the prior year was primarily due to higher interest rates on earning assets and the MUB acauisition, partially offset by the impact of deposit mix and pricing. The increase in noninterest income reflected higher commercial products revenue, payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees and other noninterest income, partially offset by losses on investment securities.\n\nNoninterest expense in 2023 was $4.0 billion (26.6 percent) higher than 2022, reflecting increased merger and integration charges and operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, including core deposit intangible amortization expense, as well as increases in compensation and employee benefits expense to support business growth and higher other noninterest expense due to the FDIC special assessment charges.\n\nResults for 2022 Compared With 2021 For discussion related to changes in financial condition and results of operations for 2022 compared with 2021, refer to \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2022, included as Exhibit 13 to the Company's Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on February 27, 2023.\n\nStatement of Income Analysis\n\nNet Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was $17.5 billion in 2023, compared with $14.8 billion in 2022. The $2.7 billion (18.1 percent) increase in 2023 compared with 2022 was primarily due to higher interest rates on earning assets and the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by the impact of deposit mix and pricing. Average earning assets were $59.9 billion (11.0 percent) higher in 2023, compared with 2022, reflecting increases in loans and interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. The net interest margin, on a taxable- equivalent basis, in 2023 was 2.90 percent, compared with 2.72 percent in 2022. The increase in the net interest margin in 2023, compared with 2022, was primarily due to the impact of higher rates on earning assets and the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by the impact of deposit mix and pricing.

The $47.7 billion (14.3 percent) increase was due to growth in the Company's legacy loan portfolio as well as balances from the MUB acquisition. Increases in residential mortgages, commercial real estate loans, commercial loans and credit card loans were partially offset by a decrease in other retail loans. Average residential mortgages increased $31.2 billion (36.8 percent), driven by the impact of the MUB acquisition, partially offset by the impact of a sale of residential mortgages in the second quarter of 2023 as part of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions. Average commercial real estate loans increased $13.5 billion (33.0 percent), primarily due to the impact of the MUB acquisition. Average commercial loans increased $11.1 billion (9.0 percent), primarily due to higher utilization driven by working capital needs of corporate customers, slower payoffs given higher volatility in the capital markets, as well as core growth and the impact related to the MUB acquisition. Average credit card loans increased $3.1 billion (13.2 percent) primarily due to higher spend volume and lower payment rates. Average other retail loans decreased $11.2 billion (18.5 percent), driven by lower auto loans\n\nprimarily due to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, along with lower installment loans.\n\nAverage investment securities in 2023 were $6.7 billion (3.9 percent) lower than in 2022, primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and liquidity management.\n\nAverage total deposits for 2023 were $43.3 billion (9.4 percent) higher than 2022. Average total savings deposits were $39.8 billion (12.8 percent) higher in 2023, compared with 2022, driven by increases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances, including the impact of the MUB acquisition. Average time deposits for 2023 were $16.1 billion (52.7 percent) higher than 2022, mainly due to the acquisition of MUB and increases in Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were $12.6 billion (10.5 percent) lower in 2023, compared with 2022, driven by decreases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking balances, partially offset by the impact of the MUB acquisition.\n\n2022\n\n%\n\n%\n\n%\n\n25",

This table does not take into account the level of noninterest- bearing funding, nor does it fully reflect changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and yield/rate.\n\nProvision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses reflects changes in economic conditions and the size and credit quality of the entire portfolio of loans. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses considered appropriate by management for expected losses, based on factors discussed in the \u201cAnalysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion in 2023, compared with $2.0 billion in 2022. The $298 million (15.1 percent) increase was driven by normalizing credit losses and stress in commercial real estate, partially offset by relative stability in the economic outlook. The provision for credit losses in 2023 included the impact of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses in\n\n2022 included the impacts of recognizing an initial provision for credit losses related to the MUB acquisition and balance sheet optimization activities in the fourth quarter of 2022, along with strong loan growth in the legacy portfolio and increasing economic uncertainty. Net charge-offs increased $842 million (79.2 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, reflecting higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent with normalizing credit conditions and adverse conditions in commercial real estate.\n\nRefer to \u201cCorporate Risk Profile\u201d for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.\n\n26 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report",

The Company's efficiency ratio was 66.7 percent in 2023, compared with 61.4 percent in 2022. The $4.0 billion (26.6 percent) increase in noninterest expense in 2023 over 2022 reflected the impact of increased merger and integration charges, as well as operating expenses related to the MUB acquisition, higher compensation and employee benefits expense, and higher other intangibles and other noninterest expense. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased 13.7 percent in 2023 over 2022, primarily due to MUB expense as well as merit increases and hiring to support business growth. Other intangibles expense increased primarily due to the core deposit intangible created as a result of the MUB acquisition. Other noninterest expense increased 58.2 percent primarily due to the $734 million FDIC special assessment charge.\n\nIncome Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was $1.4 billion (an effective rate of 20.5 percent) in 2023, compared with $1.5 billion (an effective rate of 20.0 percent) in 2022.\n\nFor further information on income taxes, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n28 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nBalance Sheet Analysis\n\nAverage earning assets were $605.2 billion in 2023, compared with $545.3 billion in 2022. The increase in average earning assets of $59.9 billion (11.0 percent) was primarily due to increases in loans of $47.7 billion (14.3 percent) and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $17.6 billion (55.9 percent), partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of $6.7 billion (3.9 percent).\n\nFor average balance information, refer to the \"Net Interest Income\" section in Statement of Income Analysis and Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on page 138.\n\nLoans The Company's loan portfolio was $373.8 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $388.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $14.4 billion (3.7 percent). The decrease was driven by decreases in other retail loans of $10.5 billion (19.1 percent), commercial loans of $3.8 billion (2.8 percent), commercial real estate loans of $2.0 billion (3.7 percent) and residential mortgages of $315 million (0.3 percent), partially offset by an increase in credit card loans of $2.3 billion (8.6 percent).

While the Company intends to hold its investment securities indefinitely, it may sell available-for-sale investment securities in response to structural changes in the balance sheet and related interest rate risk and to meet liquidity requirements, among other factors.\n\nInvestment securities totaled $153.8 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $161.7 billion at December 31, 2022. The $7.9 billion (4.9 percent) decrease was primarily due to $10.5 billion of net investment sales and maturities, partially offset by a $1.6 billion favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities. Investment securities by type are shown in Table 13.\n\nThe Company's available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a security's unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. At December 31, 2023, the Company's net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $6.9 billion ($5.2 billion net-of-tax), compared with net unrealized losses of $8.5 billion ($6.4 billion net-of-tax) at December 31, 2022. The favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to increases in the fair value of mortgage-backed, U.S. Treasury and agencies and state and political subdivisions securities as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaled $7.1 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $8.6 billion at December 31, 2022. When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers various factors such as the nature of the investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of the underlying collateral, the existence of any government or agency guarantees, and market conditions.\n\n34 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.\n\nRefer to Notes 5 and 22 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on investment securities.\n\nDeposits Total deposits were $512.3 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $525.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The $12.7 billion (2.4 percent) decrease in total deposits reflected a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by increases in time deposits and total savings deposits.\n\nNoninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2023, decreased $47.8 billion (34.7 percent) from December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven by lower Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances.\n\nTime deposits at December 31, 2023, increased $19.3 billion (58.7 percent), compared with December 31, 2022, driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics.",

        "text": "Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term borrowings, were $15.3 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $31.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The $15.9 billion (51.1 percent) decrease in short-term borrowings at December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, was primarily due to decreases in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances.\n\nLong-term debt was $51.5 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $39.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The $11.7 billion (29.3 percent) increase was primarily due to $8.2 billion of medium-term note issuances, a $7.1 billion increase in FHLB advances, partially offset by $2.8 billion of bank note repayments and maturities and a $936 million repayment of the Company's debt obligation to MUFG.\n\nRefer to Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and the \u201cLiquidity Risk Management\u201d section for discussion of liquidity management of the Company.\n\nCorporate Risk Profile\n\nOverview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy requirements.\n\nThe Executive Risk Committee (\u201cERC\u201d), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the executive management team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established, each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk.\n\nUpon closing of the MUB acquisition, the Company's risk management framework applied to the legal entities\n\n35\n\nacquired from MUFG, including MUB, up until its merger into USBNA. Updates were made to align the acquired entities with the Company's risk appetite and connect the elements of their respective risk governance and reporting into the Company's existing risk management framework. Upon completing the merger of MUB into USBNA, which occurred on May 26, 2023, the MUB risk governance and reporting framework is no longer applicable.",

        "text": "The Company's most prominent risk\n\nare credit, interest rate,\n\nexposures market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale investment securities, mortgage loans held for sale (\u2018MLHFS\u201d), mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\") and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the Company's inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational tisk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance requirements and the Company's compliance policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the Company\u2019s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors\u201d beginning on page 140 for a detailed discussion of these",

The second line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer's organization as well as policy and oversight activities of\n\n36 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\ncorporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies, and provides reporting and escalation of emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Company's governance, risk management and control processes.\n\nManagement regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with management the Company's risk management performance, and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports by management assessing the Company's performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including:\n\n+ Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical events, and technology and cybersecurity;\n\n* Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits;\n\n+ Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk (\u201cVaR\u201d);\n\n+ Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios;\n\n* Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures;\n\n* Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and\n\n* Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses.\n\nCredit Risk Management The Company's strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company's credit risk management process.\n\nIn addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the Company, are an important part of the Company's overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for",

        "text": "credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company's rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating, including consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual, encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company's internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status, except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated. For this limited population, the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows. Refer to Notes 1 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company's loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings.\n\nThe Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company's two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending.\n\nThe commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the borrower's business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower's debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment.\n\nThe consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases and home equity loans and lines. Home equity or second mortgage loans are junior lien closed-end accounts fully disbursed at origination. These loans typically are fixed rate loans, secured by residential real estate, with a 10- or 15-year fixed payment amortization schedule. Home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances repeatedly, up to a maximum commitment, and are secured by residential real estate. These include accounts in either a first or junior lien position. Typical terms on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate, with a 10-",

At December 31, 2023, substantially all of the Company\u2019s home equity lines were in the draw period. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings and other macroeconomic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value (\u201cLTV\u201d) information reflecting current market conditions on real estate-based loans. These and other risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment.\n\nThe Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.\n\nBecause business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk, including derivative transactions for balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit overdrafts and interest rate contracts for customers, investments in securities and other financial assets, and settlement risk, including Automated Clearing House transactions and the processing of credit card transactions for merchants. These activities are subject to credit review, analysis and approval processes.\n\nEconomic and Other Factors In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer- specific concentrations), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings.\n\nDuring 2023, economic uncertainty and recession risk stabilized as inflation began to subside. Borrowers continued to experience the lagged impact of elevated interest rates on earnings potential. In addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of economic deterioration on selected borrowers\u2019 liquidity and ability to repay.\n\nCredit Diversification The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, and identification of credit concentrations. As part of its normal business activities, the Company offers a broad array of traditional commercial lending products and specialized products such as asset-based lending, commercial lease financing, agricultural credit, warehouse\n\n37",

The Company also offers an array of consumer lending products, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, auto loans, retail leases, home equity loans and lines, revolving credit arrangements and other consumer loans. These consumer lending products are primarily offered through the branch office network, home mortgage and loan production offices, mobile and online banking, and indirect distribution channels, such as auto and recreational vehicle dealers. The Company monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry, customer and geography. The Company has significant loan exposure within California given its strategic position in those markets and size of the economy. Table 6 provides information with respect to the overall product diversification and changes in the mix during 2023.\n\nThe commercial loan class is diversified among various industries with higher concentrations in financial institutions and real estate. Table 8 provides a summary of significant industry groups and geographical locations of commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe commercial real estate loan class reflects the Company's focus on serving business owners within its local network, as well as regional and national investment-based real estate owners and developers. Within the commercial real estate loan class, different property types have varying degrees of credit risk. Table 9 provides a summary of the significant property types and geographical locations of commercial real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2023 and 2022. Commercial real estate loans are diversified among various property types with higher concentrations in multi-family, business owner-occupied and office properties. The commercial real estate office sector, which represented 13.0 percent of commercial real estate loans and 1.9 percent of total loans at December 31, 2023, is driving stress in this sector. The Company believes it has prudently monitored this portfolio and established an allowance to loan coverage ratio of approximately 10 percent as of December 31, 2023. Office nonperforming loans represented 7.6 percent of total office loans at December 31, 2023. The Company's commercial real estate multi-family portfolio is underwritten on the basis of current in place cash flows without consideration to any potential net benefits of the ability to convert rent-stabilized units to market rate. The Company's exposure to rent- stabilized properties in the New York City market is de minimis.\n\nThe Company's consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and online banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles.\n\n38 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nResidential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Company's branches, loan production offices, mobile and online services, and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company's portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process.",

LTV is the ratio of the loan\u2019s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value (\u201cCLTV\u2019) is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.\n\nThe following tables provide summary information of residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by LTV at December 31, 2023:",

Loans and lines in a junior lien position at December 31, 2023, included approximately $3.1 billion of loans and lines for which the Company also serviced the related first lien loan, and approximately $7.4 billion where the Company did not service the related first lien loan. The Company was able to determine the status of the related first liens using information the Company has as the servicer of the first lien or information reported on customer credit bureau files. The Company also evaluates other indicators of credit risk for these junior lien loans and lines, including delinquency, estimated average CLTV ratios and updated weighted-average credit scores in making its assessment of credit risk, related loss estimates and determining the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of delinquency statistics and other credit quality indicators for the Company's junior lien positions at December 31, 2023:\n\nJunior Liens Behind",

Including these loans, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past due and nonperforming to total residential mortgages was 2.00 percent and 2.28 percent at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nLoan Delinquencies Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within the Company\u2019s loan portfolios. The entire balance of a loan account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the date specified on the billing statement. Delinquent loans purchased and loans that could be purchased from GNMA mortgage pools under delinquent loan repurchase options whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, are excluded from delinquency statistics. In addition, in certain situations, a consumer lending customer's account may be re-aged to remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the purpose of re-aging accounts is to assist customers who have recently overcome temporary financial difficulties and have demonstrated both the ability and willingness to resume regular payments. In addition, the Company may re-age the consumer lending account of a customer who has experienced longer-term financial difficulties and apply modified, concessionary terms and conditions to the account. Commercial lending loans are generally not subject to re-aging policies.\n\nAccruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $698 million at December 31, 2023, compared with $491 million at December 31, 2022. Accruing loans 90 days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral, are in the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status, or are managed in homogeneous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines. The ratio of accruing loans 90 days or more past due to total loans was 0.19 percent at December 31, 2023, compared with 0.13 percent at December 31, 2022.\n\n40 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\n88\n\n37\n\n38 %",

In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered.\n\nModified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater.\n\nThe Company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Many of the Company's loan modifications are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the Company's loan classes. Commercial lending segment modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan.\n\nThe Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan modification programs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments. These modifications may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan modification programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time.\n\nCredit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months.\n\nThe Company also makes short-term modifications, in limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships, including previously offering payment relief to borrowers that experienced financial hardship resulting directly from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Short-term consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed.",

        "text": "Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs were $1.9 billion in 2023, compared with $1.1 billion in 2022. The $842 million (79.2 percent) increase in total net charge-offs in 2023, compared with 2022, reflected higher charge-offs in most loan categories consistent with normalizing credit conditions and adverse conditions in commercial real estate, along with the impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions in 2023 and 2022. Net charge-offs in 2023 included charge-offs related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023, along with charge-offs in the first quarter of 2023 related to the uncollectible amount of acquired loans, which were considered purchased credit deteriorated as of the date of the MUB acquisition. Net charge-offs in 2022 included charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to uncollectible amounts on acquired loans and balance sheet optimization activities. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.50 percent in 2023, compared with 0.32 percent in 2022. Excluding the impact of charge-offs related to the MUB acquisition and balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions, the ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding was 0.39 percent in 2023, compared with 0.21 percent in 2022. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for additional information.\n\nResidential mortgage loan net charge-offs for 2023 were $109 million (0.09 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with a net recovery of $23 million (0.03 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2022. Credit card loan net charge-offs in 2023 were $849 million (3.20 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $524 million (2.23 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2022. Other retail loan net charge-offs for 2023 were $370 million (0.75 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $298 million (0.49 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2022. The increase in total residential mortgage, credit card and other retail loan net charge-offs in 2023, compared with 2022, was driven by normalizing credit conditions along with charge-offs related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in 2023.\n\nAnalysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company's loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.\n\nCommercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs for 2023 were $577 million (0.30 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with $264 million (0.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2022. The increase in net charge-offs in 2023, compared with 2022, was driven primarily by normalizing credit conditions and adverse conditions in commercial real estate.\n\nManagement evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses.

        "text": "Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company's expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.\n\nBecause business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company\u2019s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios.\n\nThe allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan modification programs, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses.\n\nThe allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate.\n\nWhen evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien.

The Company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. Regardless of whether the Company services the first lien, an assessment is made of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. Based on the available information, the Company estimated $204 million or 1.6 percent of its total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2023, represented non-delinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified.\n\nWhen a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration (\u201cPCD\u201d) and those not considered PCD. An allowance is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio and delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also consider whether the loan has experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant deterioration since origination. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company had a total net book balance of $3.1 billion of PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB acquisition, included in its loan portfolio at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company's methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company's allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.\n\nThe results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio. Table 19 shows the amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan class and underlying portfolio category.\n\nAlthough the Company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was $7.8 billion, compared with an allowance of $7.4 billion\n\n45\n\nat December 31, 2022. The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 included a $62 million decrease due to a change in accounting principle adopted on January 1, 2023 related to discontinuing the separate recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\"). The increase in the allowance for credit losses of $435 million (5.9 percent) at December 31, 2023, compared with December 31, 2022, was primarily driven by normalizing credit losses, credit card balance growth and commercial real estate credit quality.",

        "text": "Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. Lease originations are subject to the same well-defined underwriting standards referred to in the \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d section, which includes an evaluation of the residual value risk. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated further by effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles.\n\nIncluded in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately $3.4 billion of retail leasing residuals at December 31, 2023, compared with $4.4 billion at December 31, 2022. The Company monitors concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle type. As of December 31, 2023, vehicle lease residuals related to sport utility vehicles were 53.5 percent of the portfolio, while truck and crossover utility vehicle classes represented approximately 21.4 percent and 13.7 percent of the portfolio, respectively. At year-end 2023, the individual vehicle model with the largest residual value outstanding represented 27.0 percent of the aggregate residual value of all vehicles in the portfolio. At December 31, 2023, the weighted-average origination term of the portfolio was 41 months, compared with 42 months at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, the commercial leasing portfolio had $491 million of residuals, compared with $500 million at December 31, 2022. At year-end 2023, lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation equipment represented 38.0 percent of the total residual portfolio, while business and office equipment represented 28.5 percent.\n\nOperational Risk Management. The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the Company's objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities, including those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial disruptions.\n\nThe Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. The Company also maintains a cybersecurity risk program which provides centralized planning and management of related and interdependent work with a focus on risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's cybersecurity risk program is integrated into the Company's overall business and operational strategies and requires that the Company allocate appropriate resources to maintain the program. Refer to \u201cItem 1C. Cybersecurity\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on the Company's cybersecurity risk program.\n\nBusiness continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to effectively managing operational risks. Each business unit of the Company is required to develop, maintain and test these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if needed, can support mission critical functions, including technology, networks and data\n\n48 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\n2022\n\n%\n\ncenters supporting customer applications and business operations.",

        "text": "While the Company strives to design processes to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute assurance that business disruption or operational losses would not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown. On an ongoing basis, management makes process changes and investments to enhance its systems of internal controls and business continuity and disaster recovery plans.\n\nCompliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation if it fails to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti- money laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and issues, including those created or increased by economic and financial disruptions. Refer to \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries.\n\nInterest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings as well as the safety and soundness of an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Management Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and overseeing compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through analysis of net interest income sensitivities across a range of scenarios.\n\nNet interest income sensitivity analysis includes evaluating all of the Company's assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, inclusive of new business activity under various interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the overall shape of the yield curve. The balance sheet includes assumptions regarding loan and deposit volumes and pricing which are based on quantitative analysis, historical trends and management outlook and strategies. Deposit balances and mix are dynamic across interest rate scenarios and will change both with the absolute level of rates as well as the assumed interest rate shock. Base case and net interest income sensitivities are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management strategies.\n\nThe Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market values of the Company's assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will change given a change in interest rates. Management\n\nmeasures the impact of changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios, including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of the yield curve. The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, executing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and deploying investment portfolio, funding and derivative strategies .",

As of December 31, 2023, the Company continues to be slightly asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with most of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary significantly.\n\nUse of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways:\n\n* To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments;\n\n* To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixed- rate payments;\n\n+ To mitigate changes in value of the Company's unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs;\n\n* To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and\n\n+ To mitigate the volatility of the Company's net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nIn addition, the Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\n49",

        "text": "The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities (\u201cTBAs\u201d), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs, including management of the changes in fair value.\n\nAdditionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS.\n\nDerivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company also mitigates the credit risk of its derivative positions, as well as the credit risk on loans or lending portfolios, through the use of credit contracts.",

The Company\u2019s Market Risk Committee (\u2018MRC\u2019), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company's Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one- year look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Company\u2019s corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as those inherent in the Company's foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the Company expects the one-day VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models\u2019 input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted.

        "text": "Liquidity Risk Management The Company's liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company\u2019s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company's profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors approves the Company's liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Company's Board of Directors oversees the Company's liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company's liquidity policy and limits, and regularly assesses the Company's ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events.\n\nThe Company's liquidity policy requires it to maintain diversified wholesale funding sources to avoid maturity, entity and market concentrations. The Company operates a Cayman Islands branch for issuing Eurodollar time deposits. In addition, the Company has relationships with dealers to issue national market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-term and medium-term notes. The Company also maintains a significant correspondent banking network and relationships. Accordingly, the Company has access to national federal funds, funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable certificates of deposit and commercial paper.\n\nThe Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Company\u2019s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on- balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank's Discount Window. Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio provide asset liquidity through the Company\u2019s ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and \u201cBalance Sheet Analysis\u201d for further information on investment securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company\u2019s practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n51\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's total available liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources:",

The parent company is currently in excess of required liquidity minimums.\n\nUnder SEC rules, the parent company is classified as a \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer,\u201d which allows it to file a registration statement that does not have a limit on issuance capacity. \u201cWell-known seasoned issuers\u201d generally include those companies with outstanding common securities with a market value of at least $700 million held by non-affiliated parties or those companies that have issued at least $1 billion in aggregate principal amount of non- convertible securities, other than common equity, in the last three years. However, the parent company\u2019s ability to issue debt and other securities under a registration statement filed with the SEC under these rules is limited by the debt issuance authority granted by the Company's Board of Directors and/or the ALCO policy.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, parent company long-term debt outstanding was $34.3 billion, compared with $27.0 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to $8.2 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by a $936 million repayment of the Company's debt obligation to MUFG. As of December 31, 2023, there was $5.6 billion of parent company debt scheduled to mature in 2024. Future debt maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash equivalents.\n\nDividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. In general, dividends to the parent company from its banking subsidiaries are limited by rules which compare dividends to net income for regulatorily-defined periods. For further information, see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (\u201cLCR\u201d) requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. At December 31, 2023, the Company was compliant with this requirement.\n\nThe Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio (\u201cNSFR\u2019) requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. At December 31, 2023, the Company was compliant with this requirement.\n\nEuropean Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately 2 percent of the Company's total net revenue for 2023. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At December 31, 2023, the Company had an aggregate\n\namount on deposit with European banks of approximately $7.3 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England.\n\nIn addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries, transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative- related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market funds that hold certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities.",

        "text": "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk support.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases for premises and equipment, and other cash commitments. Refer to Notes 7, 12, 14, 17 and 23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Company\u2019s operating lease obligations, deposits, long-term debt, benefit obligations and guarantees and other commitments, respectively.\n\nCommitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Many of the Company's commitments to extend credit expire without being drawn and, therefore, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements or the Company's exposure to credit loss. Commitments to extend credit also include consumer credit lines that are cancellable upon notification to the consumer. Total contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2023 were $400.5 billion. The Company also issues and confirms various types of letters of credit, including standby and commercial. Total contractual amounts of letters of credit at December 31, 2023 were $11.6 billion. For more information on the Company's commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, refer to Note 23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities primarily consist of private investment funds or partnerships that make equity investments, provide debt financing or support community-based investments in tax-advantaged projects. In addition to providing investment returns, these arrangements in many cases assist the Company in complying with requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. The investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other\n\n53\n\ntax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. The entities in which the Company invests are generally considered variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). The Company's recorded investment in these entities, net of contractual equity investment commitments of $3.6 billion, was $3.0 billion at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company also has non-controlling financial investments in private funds and partnerships considered VIEs. The Company's recorded investment in these entities was approximately $219 million at December 31, 2023, and the Company had unfunded commitments to invest an additional $100 million. For more information on the Company's interests in unconsolidated VIEs, refer to Note 8 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "text": "Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company to customers or other third parties requiring the Company to perform if certain conditions exist or upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event, such as a scheduled payment to be made under contract. The Company's primary guarantees include commitments from securities lending activities in which indemnifications are provided to customers; indemnification or buy-back provisions related to sales of loans and tax credit investments; and merchant charge-back guarantees through the Company\u2019s involvement in providing merchant processing services. For certain guarantees, the Company may have access to collateral to support the guarantee, or through the exercise of other recourse provisions, be able to offset some or all of any payments made under these guarantees.\n\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries, along with other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks, have a contingent guarantee obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. for potential losses arising from antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International. The indemnification by the Company and other Visa U.S.A. Inc. member banks has no maximum amount. Refer to Note 23 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding guarantees, other commitments, and contingent liabilities, including maximum potential future payments and current carrying amounts.\n\nCapital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments.\n\nThe Company announced on December 12, 2023 that its Board of Directors had approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.49 per common share. This represented a 2.1 percent increase over the previous dividend rate per common share of $0.48 per quarter.\n\nThe Company announced on December 22, 2020 that its Board of Directors had approved an authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of its common stock beginning\n\n54 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nJanuary 1, 2021. The Company suspended all common stock repurchases at the beginning of the third quarter of 2021, except for those done exclusively in connection with its stock-based compensation programs, due to its acquisition of MUB. The Company will evaluate its share repurchases in connection with the potential capital requirements given proposed regulatory capital rules and related landscape.\n\nCapital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to the approval of the Company's Board of Directors and compliance with regulatory requirements. For a more complete analysis of activities impacting shareholders\u2019 equity and capital management programs, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTotal U.S. Bancorp shareholders\u2019 equity was $55.3 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with $50.8 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily the result of corporate earnings, the issuance of shares of common stock and changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by dividends paid. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company issued 24 million shares of common stock of the Company to an affiliate of MUFG for a purchase price of $936 million. The proceeds of the issuance were used to repay a portion of the Company's $3.5 billion debt obligation to MUFG. See \u201cMUFG Union Bank Acquisition\u201d on page 22 for further information.",

        "text": "The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel Ill, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Under Basel Ill, banking regulators define minimum capital requirements for banks and financial services holding companies. These requirements are expressed in the form of a minimum common eauity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio and a tier 1 total leverage exposure, or supplementary leverage, ratio. The Company's minimum required level for these ratios at December 31, 2023, which include a stress capital buffer of 2.5 percent for the common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total capital ratios, was 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent, 10.5 percent, 4.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding company level, to exceed the \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d threshold for these ratios under the FDIC Improvement Act prompt corrective action provisions that are applicable to all banks. At December 31, 2023, the minimum \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d thresholds under the prompt corrective action framework for the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tier 1 leverage ratio, and tier 1 total leverage exposure ratio was 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent, 5.0 percent, and 3.0 percent, respectively. Beginning in 2022, the Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases during 2020\n\nand 2021. This cumulative deferred impact will continue to be phased into the Company's regulatory capital over the next year, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2023, USBNA met all regulatory capital ratios to be\n\nconsidered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2023 that management believes have changed the risk-based category of USBNA.",

All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d requirements.\n\nIn July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities proposed a rule implementing the Basel Committee\u2019s finalization of the post-crisis regulatory capital reforms. The proposal provides for a July 1, 2025 effective date, subject to a three-year transition period. The proposal includes the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, which replaces the market risk rule, and introduces new standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, which would replace the current models-based approaches. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule and expects that any final rule would result in the Company being required to maintain increased levels of regulatory capital.\n\nThe Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company's tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in\n\naccordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL methodology under the standardized approach, was 5.3 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023, compared with 4.5 percent and 6.0 percent at December 31, 2022, respectively. In addition, the Company\u2019s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology was 9.7 percent at December 31, 2023, compared with 8.1 percent at December 31, 2022. Refer to \u201cNon-GAAP. Financial Measures\u201d beginning on page 59 for further information on these other capital ratios.\n\nAs an approved mortgage seller and servicer, USBNA, through its mortgage banking division, is required to maintain various levels of shareholder's equity, as specified by various agencies, including the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association. At December 31, 2023, USBNA met these requirements.\n\n55",

Refer to Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the business lines\u2019 basis for financial presentation.\n\nDesignations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company's diverse customer base. During 2023, certain organization and methodology changes were made, including the Company combining its Wealth Management and Investment Services and Corporate and Commercial Banking lines of businesses to create the Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking line of business. 2022 results were restated and presented on a comparable basis.\n\nWealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking provides core banking, specialized lending, transaction and payment processing, capital markets, asset management, and brokerage and investment related services to wealth, middle market, large corporate, government and institutional clients. Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking contributed $3.6 billion of the Company's net income in 2023, or an increase of $202 million (6.0 percent), compared with 2022.\n\nNet revenue increased $1.5 billion (17.1 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $916 million (17.6 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to the impact of higher rates on the margin benefit from deposits and the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by the impact of deposit mix and pricing. Noninterest income increased $582 million (16.3 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to higher trust and investment management fees driven by the acquisition of MUB and core business growth, and higher commercial products revenue mainly due to higher trading revenue and corporate bond fees.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.0 billion (25.3 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to higher FDIC insurance expense driven by an increase in the assessment base and rate along with the inclusion of MUB in the current year. Compensation and employee benefits expense and net shared services expense were also higher, driven by investment in support of business growth and the impact of the MUB acquisition, including intangible amortization driven by the core deposit intangible. The provision for credit losses increased $180 million in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to commercial real estate credit quality.\n\nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small\n\n56 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nbusiness banking and consumer lending. Products and services are delivered through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, online services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business partners. Consumer and Business Banking contributed $2.2 billion of the Company\u2019s net income in 2023, or an increase of $378 million (20.6 percent), compared with 2022.",

Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $1.6 billion (23.2 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, reflecting the favorable impact of higher rates on the margin benefit of deposits and the acquisition of MUB, partially offset by the impact of deposit mix and pricing. Noninterest income increased $126 million (8.2 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to higher mortgage banking revenue driven by increases in MSR valuations, net of hedging activities, along with the impact of the MUB acquisition.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $1.2 billion (20.5 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits expense and net shared services expense due to investments in digital capabilities, and the impact of the MUB acquisition, including intangible amortization driven by the core deposit intangible. The provision for credit losses increased $4 million (5.3 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, due to normalizing credit conditions, partially offset by declining loan balances.\n\nPayment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed $1.2 billion of the Company's net income in 2023, or a decrease of $150 million (11.2 percent), compared with 2022.\n\nNet revenue increased $460 million (7.3 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased $198 million (7.9 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to higher loan yields driven by higher interest rates and lower payment rates, along with higher loan balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income increased $262 million (6.9 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, driven by higher card revenue and merchant processing services revenue due to higher spend volume, along with higher corporate payment products revenue due to product mix.\n\nNoninterest expense increased $247 million (7.0 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, reflecting higher net shared services expense driven by investment in infrastructure and technology development, in addition to higher compensation and employee benefits expense as a result of merit increases and core business growth. The provision for credit losses increased $414 million (42.2 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to normalizing credit conditions exhibited through increasing delinquency and credit loss rates.\n\nTreasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company's investment portfolios,\n\nfunding, capital management, interest rate risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded a net loss of $1.5 billion in 2023, compared with a net loss of $716 million in 2022.\n\nNet revenue increased $191 million (20.5 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022. Noninterest income increased $191 million (33.8 percent) in 2023, compared with 2022, primarily due to the impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022, partially offset by losses on the sale of investment securities in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to balance sheet repositioning. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was unchanged in 2023, compared with 2022, driven by higher funding costs, offset by higher yields on the investment portfolio and cash balances.",

These increases were partially offset by lower net shared services expense.

        "text": "*Not meaningful\n\n58 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\n13.1\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nIn addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including:\n\n* Tangible common equity to tangible assets,\n\n* Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and\n\n+ Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology.\n\nThese capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company's utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company's capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude the impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Company's capital adequacy.\n\nThe Company discloses the return on tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share as it believes they are useful financial measures to assess the Company's use of equity.\n\nThe Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non- GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax- exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable- equivalent basis.\n\nThe Company also discloses the net charge-off ratio and return on tangible common equity ratio excluding notable items related to the acquisition of MUB, and other balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken by the Company. Management believes these measures enhance comparability with prior periods.\n\nThe Company also discloses percent of net revenue for its business lines excluding Treasury and Corporate Support to highlight the contributions to net revenue from the Company's core revenue-producing businesses.\n\nThere may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\n59\n\nThe following tables show the Company's calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures:",

To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the Company's financial condition or results of operations, the impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nconformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company's financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding the Company's financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements. These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information (including third-party\n\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in\n\n2023\n\n61\n\nsources or available prices), sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under GAAP. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the Company's Audit Committee.\n\nSignificant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are described below.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses Management's evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Annual Report.\n\nThe methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2023 are discussed in the \u201cCredit Risk Management\u201d section. Although methodologies utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect management's assessment of credit risk, imprecision exists in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect credit loss reserve estimates.",

        "text": "Given the many quantitative variables and subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly coincide with changes in risk ratings or delinquency status within loan and lease portfolios. This is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans within tisk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of charge- offs and expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses measures the expected loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure, while nonperforming loans and net charge-offs are measures of specific impairment events that have already been confirmed. Therefore, the degree of change in the forward-looking expected loss in the allowance may differ from the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses by updating allowance rates to reflect changes in expected losses, including expected changes in economic or business cycle conditions. Some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are more readily quantifiable while other factors require extensive qualitative judgment in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses.\n\nThe Company considers a range of economic scenarios in its determination of the allowance for credit losses. These scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses, and also the expectation that conditions will eventually normalize over the longer run. Scenarios worse than the Company's expected outcome at December 31, 2023 include risks of later than expected cuts in the federal funds rate, persisting\n\n62 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\ninflationary pressures, continually elevated high interest rates, declines in residential and commercial real estate prices, high unemployment rates, supply shortages, geopolitical risks, bank tightening and lingering concerns of future bank failures, which could all precipitate a moderate to severe recession and result in increased credit losses.\n\nUnder the range of economic scenarios considered, the allowance for credit losses would have been lower by $1.1 billion or higher by $2.3 billion. This range reflects the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses specifically related to the scenarios and weights considered as of December 31, 2023, and does not consider other potential adjustments that could increase or decrease loss estimates calculated using alternative economic scenarios.\n\nBecause several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the economy on the Company's modeled loss estimates for the loan portfolio and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Company, management believes the risk ratings and loss model estimates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the Company's financial statements.

        "text": "Fair Value Estimates A portion of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These include all of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities, derivatives and other trading instruments, MSRs and MLHFS. The estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale, which are recorded at the lower-of-cost-or-fair value. The determination of fair value is important for certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates, including goodwill. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on fair value estimates of assets and liabilities assumed in the MUB acquisition.\n\nFair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently verified against observable market data where possible. Where observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated\n\nbased on management's judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nWhen available, trading and available-for-sale securities are valued based on quoted market prices. However, certain securities are traded less actively and, therefore, quoted market prices may not be available. The determination of fair value may require benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash flows and prepayment, interest and default rates. For more information on investment securities, refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange, the majority of the Company's derivative positions are valued using valuation techniques that use readily observable market inputs. Certain derivatives, however, must be valued using techniques that include unobservable inputs. For these instruments, the significant assumptions must be estimated and, therefore, are subject to judgment. Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of the Company\u2019s derivative positions.\n\nRefer to Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding estimations of fair value.",

        "text": "Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained, or may be purchased from others. The Company records MSRs at fair value. Because MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, option adjusted spread, and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and independent third-party valuations. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in earnings during the period in which they occur. Risks inherent in the valuation of MSRs include higher than expected prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The Company utilizes derivatives, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures, to mitigate the valuation risk. Refer to Notes 10 and 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the assumptions used in determining the fair value of MSRs and an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative instruments used to mitigate the valuation risk.\n\nIncome Taxes The Company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates, including federal, state and local domestic jurisdictions, and an insignificant amount to foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Accrued taxes are reported in other\n\nassets or other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management's judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. In estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of accrued taxes.\n\nChanges in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the Company. Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.",

        "text": "Report of Management\n\nResponsibility for the financial statements and other information presented throughout this Annual Report rests with the management of U.S. Bancorp. The Company believes the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and present the substance of transactions based on the circumstances and management's best estimates and judgment.\n\nIn meeting its responsibilities for the reliability of the financial statements, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as defined by Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of publicly filed financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nTo test compliance, the Company carries out an extensive audit program. This program includes a review for compliance with written policies and procedures and a comprehensive review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal control. Although control procedures are designed and tested, it must be recognized that there are limits inherent in all systems of internal control and, therefore, errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur. Projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee composed of directors who are independent of U.S. Bancorp. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and the independent accountants to consider audit results and to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters.\n\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on its assessment and those criteria, management believes the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report appearing on page 65.\n\n64 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report",

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nGrnet peg\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota February 20, 2024\n\nof\n\nof\n\n65\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of U.S. Bancorp\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d).

        "text": "Allowance for Credit Losses\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nThe Company's loan and lease portfolio and the associated allowance for credit losses (ACL), were $373.8 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements, the ACL is established for current expected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments, by utilizing forward-looking expected loss models. When determining expected losses, the Company uses multiple probability weighted economic scenarios over a reasonable and supportable forecast period and then fully reverts to historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining asset lives. Model estimates are adjusted to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices or economic conditions that would affect the accuracy of the model. Additionally, management may adjust ACL for other qualitative factors such as model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the environment that are affecting specific portfolio segments, or changes in portfolio concentrations.\n\nAuditing management's ACL estimate and related provision for credit losses was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the probability weighted economic scenarios, expected loss models, as well as model and qualitative factor adjustments.\n\n66 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nbased\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's process for establishing the ACL, including management's controls over: 1) selection and implementation of forward-looking economic scenarios and the probability weights assigned to them; 2) expected loss models, including model validation, implementation, monitoring, the completeness and accuracy key inputs and assumptions used in the models, and management's output assessment and related adjustments; 3) adjustments to reflect management's consideration of qualitative factors; 4) the ACL methodology and governance process.",

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) provide a full range of financial services, including lending and depository services through banking offices principally in the Midwest and West regions of the United States, through online services, over mobile devices and through other distribution channels. The Company also engages in credit card, merchant, and ATM processing, mortgage banking, cash management, capital markets, insurance, trust and investment management, brokerage, and leasing activities, principally in domestic markets.\n\nBasis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and all VIEs for which the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Consolidation eliminates intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain items in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n\nUses of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual experience could differ from those estimates and assumptions.\n\nSecurities\n\nRealized gains or losses on securities are determined on a trade date basis based on the specific amortized cost of the investments sold.\n\nTrading Securities Securities held for resale are classified as trading securities and are included in other assets and reported at fair value. Changes in fair value and realized gains or losses are reported in noninterest income.\n\nAvailable-for-sale Securities Debt securities that are not trading securities but may be sold before maturity in response to changes in the Company's interest rate risk profile, funding needs, demand for collateralized deposits by public entities or other reasons, are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within other comprehensive income (loss). Declines in fair value related to credit, if any, are recorded through the establishment of an allowance for credit losses.\n\nHeld-to-maturity Securities Debt securities for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.\n\n74 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nExpected credit losses, if any, are recorded through the establishment of an allowance for credit losses.\n\nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions with a receivable or payable recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. Collateral requirements are continually monitored and additional collateral is received or provided as required. The Company records a receivable or payable for cash collateral paid or received.",

        "text": "Loans\n\nThe Company offers a broad array of lending products and categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company's two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending. The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans.\n\nOriginated Loans Held for Investment Loans the Company originates as held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned interest income and deferred fees and costs, and any direct principal charge-offs. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balances as earned. Loan and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the loan and/or commitment period as yield adjustments.\n\nPurchased Loans All purchased loans are recorded at fair value at the date of purchase and those acquired on or after January 1, 2020 are divided into those considered PCD and those not considered PCD. An allowance for credit losses is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio, delinquency status and refreshed loan-to-value ratios when possible. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance.\n\nCommitments to Extend Credit Unfunded commitments for residential mortgage loans intended to be held for sale are considered derivatives and recorded in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest income. All other unfunded loan commitments are not considered derivatives and are not reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Reserves for credit exposure on all other unfunded credit commitments are recorded in other liabilities.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis.",

        "text": "Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates, from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company\u2019s expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.\n\nThe allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and corporate bonds spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan modification programs, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or other factors that would affect the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on collateral dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses. The allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than $5 million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For smaller commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment, historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans.",

        "text": "The Company's methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in the quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the environment that are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company's allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio.\n\nThe Company also assesses the credit risk associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments, letters of credit, investment securities and derivatives. Credit risk associated with derivatives is reflected in the fair values recorded for those positions. The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments and other credit guarantees is included in other liabilities. Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments.\n\n75\n\nThe results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each specific loan portfolio, as well as the entire loan portfolio, as the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio.\n\nCredit Quality The credit quality of the Company's loan portfolios is assessed as a function of net credit losses, levels of nonperforming assets and delinquencies, and credit quality ratings as defined by the Company.\n\nFor all loan portfolio classes, loans are considered past due based on the number of days delinquent except for monthly amortizing loans which are classified delinquent based upon the number of contractually required payments not made (for example, two missed payments is considered 30 days delinquent). When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed, reducing interest income in the current period.\n\nCommercial lending segment loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and interest has become 90 days past due or is otherwise considered doubtful. Commercial lending segment loans are generally fully charged down if unsecured by collateral or partially charged down to the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, less costs to sell, when the loan is placed on nonaccrual.",

        "text": "Consumer lending segment loans are generally charged-off at a specific number of days or payments past due. Residential mortgages and other retail loans secured by 1-4 family properties are generally charged down to the fair value of the collateral securing the loan, less costs to sell, at 180 days past due. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a first lien position are placed on nonaccrual status in instances where a partial charge-off occurs unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position secured by 1-4 family properties are placed on nonaccrual status at 120 days past due or when they are behind a first lien that has become 180 days or greater past due or placed on nonaccrual status. Any secured consumer lending segment loan whose borrower has had debt discharged through bankruptcy, for which the loan amount exceeds the fair value of the collateral, is charged down to the fair value of the related collateral and the remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual status. Credit card loans continue to accrue interest until the account is charged-off. Credit cards are charged-off at 180 days past due. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4 family properties are charged-off at 120 days past due; and revolving consumer lines are charged-off at 180 days past due. Similar to credit cards, other retail loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status because of the relative short period of time to charge-off. Certain retail customers having financial difficulties may have the terms of their credit card and other loan agreements modified to require only principal payments and, as such, are reported as nonaccrual.\n\nFor all loan classes, interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are generally recorded as a reduction to a loan\u2019s carrying amount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are recognized as interest income upon payoff of the loan. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is\n\n76 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nbelieved to be collectible. In certain circumstances, loans in any class may be restored to accrual status, such as when a loan has demonstrated sustained repayment performance or no amounts are past due and prospects for future payment are no longer in doubt; or when the loan becomes well secured and is in the process of collection. Loans where there has been a partial charge-off may be returned to accrual status if all principal and interest (including amounts previously charged-off) is expected to be collected and the loan is current.\n\nThe Company classifies its loan portfolio classes using internal credit quality ratings on a quarterly basis. These ratings include pass, special mention and classified, and are an important part of the Company's overall credit risk management process and evaluation of the allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company\u2019s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Special mention loans are those loans that have a potential weakness deserving management's close attention. Classified loans are those loans where a well-defined weakness has been identified that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. It is possible that others, given the same information, may reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the credit quality rating classification of specific loans.",

        "text": "Loan Modifications In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. The Company recognizes interest on modified loans if full collection of contractual principal and interest is expected. The effects of modifications on credit loss expectations, such as improved payment capacity, longer expected lives and other factors, are considered when measuring the allowance for credit losses. Modification performance, including redefault rates and how these compare to historical losses, are also considered. Modifications generally do not result in significant changes to the Company's allowance for credit losses.\n\nFor the commercial lending segment, modifications generally result in the Company working with borrowers on a case-by-case basis. Commercial and commercial real estate modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate. In addition, the Company may work with the borrower in identifying other changes that mitigate loss to the Company, which may include additional collateral or guarantees to support the loan. To a lesser extent, the Company may provide an interest rate reduction.\n\nModifications for the consumer lending segment are generally part of programs the Company has initiated. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, or its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments. These modifications may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extension of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of\n\naccrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In most instances, participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time.\n\nCredit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers experiencing financial difficulty with modifications whereby balances may be amortized up to 60 months, and generally include waiver of fees and reduced interest rates.\n\nLeases The Company, as a lessor, originates retail and commercial leases either directly to the consumer or indirectly through dealer networks. Retail leases, primarily automobiles, have terms up to 5 years. Commercial leases may include high dollar assets such as aircraft or lower cost items such as office equipment. At lease inception, retail lease customers may be provided with an end-of-term purchase option, which is based on the contractual residual value of the automobile at the expiration of the lease. Automobile leases do not typically contain options to extend or terminate the lease. Equipment leases may contain various types of purchase options. Some option amounts are a stated value, while others are determined using the fair market value at the time of option exercise.",

        "text": "Residual values on leased assets are reviewed regularly for impairment. Residual valuations for retail leases are based on independent assessments of expected used automobile sale prices at the end of the lease term. Impairment tests are conducted based on these valuations considering the probability of the lessee returning the asset to the Company, re-marketing efforts, insurance coverage and ancillary fees and costs. Valuations for commercial leases are based upon external or internal management appraisals. The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other assets through disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. Retail lease residual value risk is mitigated further by the purchase of residual value insurance coverage and effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles.\n\nThe Company, as lessee, leases certain assets for use in its operations. Leased assets primarily include retail branches, operations centers and other corporate locations, and, to a lesser extent, office and computer equipment. For each lease with an original term greater than 12 months, the Company records a lease liability and a corresponding right of use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset. The Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components in the majority of its lease contracts as a single lease component, with the determination of the lease liability at lease inception based on the present value of the consideration to be paid under the contract. The discount rate used by the Company is determined at commencement of the lease using a secured rate for a similar term as the period of the lease. The\n\nCompany\u2019s leases do not include significant variable lease payments.\n\nCertain of the Company\u2019s real estate leases include options to extend. Lease extension options are generally exercisable at market rates. Such option periods do not provide a significant incentive, and their exercise is not reasonably certain. Accordingly, the Company does not generally recognize payments occurring during option periods in the calculation of its ROU assets and lease liabilities.\n\nOther Real Estate OREO is included in other assets, and is property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings on defaulted loans. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs. The fair value of OREO is evaluated regularly and any decreases in value along with holding costs, such as taxes and insurance, are reported in noninterest expense.",

LHFS are carried at the lower-of-cost-or-fair value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan with the exception of loans for which the Company has elected fair value accounting, which are carried at fair value. Any writedowns to fair value upon the transfer of loans to LHFS are reflected in loan charge-offs.\n\nWhere an election is made to carry the LHFS at fair value, any change in fair value is recognized in noninterest income. Where an election is made to carry LHFS at lower-of-cost-or-fair value, any further decreases are recognized in noninterest income and increases in fair value above the loan cost basis are not recognized until the loans are sold. Fair value elections are made at the time of origination or purchase based on the Company's fair value election policy. The Company has elected fair value accounting for substantially all its MLHFS.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to accommodate the business requirements of its customers. Derivative instruments are reported in other assets or other liabilities at fair value. Changes in a derivative\u2019s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.\n\nAll derivative instruments that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value and classified as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (\u201cfair value hedge\u201d); a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (\u201ccash flow hedge\u201d); or a hedge of the volatility of a net investment in foreign operations driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates (\u201cnet investment hedge\u201d). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge, and the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item, are recorded in earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is\n\n77\n\nhighly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until cash flows of the hedged item are realized. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges that are highly effective are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a minimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged item(s).\n\nIf a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in other comprehensive income (loss) is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in other comprehensive income (loss) is reported in earnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts remain within other comprehensive income (loss).",

Certain revenues are generated from contracts where they are recognized when, or as services or products are transferred to customers for amounts the Company expects to be entitled.

Certain specific policies include the following:\n\nCard Revenue Card revenue includes interchange from credit, debit and stored-value cards processed through card association networks, annual fees, and other transaction and account management fees. Interchange rates are generally set by the card associations and based on purchase volumes and other factors. The Company records interchange as services are provided. Transaction and account management fees are recognized as services are provided, except for annual fees which are recognized over the applicable period. Costs for rewards programs and certain payments to partners and card associations are also recorded within card revenue when services are provided.

        "text": "Other Significant Policies\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is recorded on acquired businesses if the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment at a reporting unit level. In certain situations, an interim impairment test may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Determining the amount of goodwill\n\nimpairment, if any, includes assessing whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Other intangible assets are recorded at their fair value upon completion of a business acquisition or certain other transactions, and generally represent the value of customer contracts or relationships. Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated methods and are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. Determining the amount of other intangible asset impairment, if any, includes assessing the present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with the intangible asset and comparing it to the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nIncome Taxes Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting carrying amounts. The Company uses the deferral method of accounting on investments that generate investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to the related asset. For investments in qualified affordable housing projects and certain other tax-advantaged investments, the Company presents the expense in tax expense rather than noninterest expense.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained or if they are purchased from others. MSRs are recorded at fair value. The Company determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the asset's future cash flows utilizing market- based prepayment rates, option adjusted spread, and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and independent third-party valuations. Changes in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in earnings as mortgage banking revenue during the period in which they occur.\n\nPensions For purposes of its pension plans, the Company utilizes its fiscal year-end as the measurement date. At the measurement date, plan assets are determined based on fair value, generally representing observable market prices or the net asset value provided by the funds\u2019 trustee or administrator. The actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expense is the projected unit credit method. The projected benefit obligation is principally determined based on the present value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. The discount rate utilized is based on the investment yield of high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace with maturities equal to projected cash flows of future benefit payments as of the measurement date. Periodic pension expense (or income) includes service costs, interest costs based on the assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value and amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Service cost is included in compensation and employee benefits expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income, with all other components of periodic pension expense included in other noninterest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses which are deferred, and to the extent exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, are amortized over the future service periods of active employees or the remaining life expectancies of inactive participants. The market-related value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on fair value adjusted for the difference between expected returns and actual performance of plan assets. The unrealized difference between actual experience and expected returns is included in expense over a period of approximately 15 years for active employees and approximately 30 years for inactive participants. The overfunded or underfunded status of each plan is recorded as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in that status recognized through other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nPremises and Equipment Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the assets. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for newly constructed buildings and from 3 to 25 years for furniture and equipment.\n\nThe Company, as lessee, records an ROU asset for each lease with an original term greater than 12 months. ROU assets are included in premises and equipment, with the corresponding lease liabilities included in long-term debt and other liabilities.\n\nCapitalized Software The Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software\u2019s expected useful life and reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis. Estimated useful lives are generally 3 to 5 years, but may range up to 7 years.\n\nStock-Based Compensation The Company grants stock-based awards, which may include restricted stock, restricted stock units and options to purchase common stock of the Company. Stock option grants are for a fixed number of shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants are awarded at no cost to the recipient. Stock-based compensation for awards is recognized in the Company's results of operations over the vesting period. The Company immediately recognizes compensation cost of awards to employees that meet retirement status, despite their continued active employment. The amortization of stock-based compensation reflects estimated forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time stock-based awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, the Company may be required to recognize an\n\n80 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nadjustment to tax expense, depending on the market price of the Company's common stock at that time.",

        "text": "Accounting Changes\n\nReference Interest Rate Transition In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued accounting guidance, providing temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance in United States generally accepted accounting principles on contract modifications and hedge accounting, to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. Under the guidance, a company can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by reference rate transition, if certain criteria are met. A company that makes this election would not be required to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. This guidance also permits a company to elect various optional expedients that would allow it to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate transition, if certain criteria are met. The guidance is effective upon issuance and generally can be applied through December 31, 2024. The Company is applying certain optional expedients and exceptions for cash flow hedges and will continue to evaluate these for eligible contract modifications and hedging relationships.\n\nFair Value Hedging \u2014 Portfolio Layer Method Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted accounting guidance, issued by the FASB in March 2022, related to fair value hedge accounting of portfolios of financial assets. This guidance permits a company to designate multiple hedging relationships on a single closed portfolio, resulting in a larger portion of the interest rate risk associated with such a portfolio being eligible to be hedged. The guidance also expands the scope of the method to include non-prepayable financial assets and clarifies other technical questions from the original accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance is not material to the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nFinancial Instruments \u2014 Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted accounting guidance on a modified retrospective basis, issued by the FASB in March 2022,\n\nrelated to the recognition and measurement of TDRs by creditors. This guidance removes the separate recognition and measurement requirements for TDRs by replacing them with a requirement for a company to apply existing accounting guidance to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. This guidance also replaces existing TDR disclosures with similar but more expansive disclosures for certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Further, this guidance also requires companies to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables. The adoption of this guidance is not material to the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nAccounting for Tax Credit Investments Using the Proportional Amortization Method Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted accounting guidance on a modified retrospective basis, issued by the FASB in March 2023, related to the accounting for tax credit investments. This guidance allows the Company to elect to account for tax credit investments using the proportional amortization method on a program-by-program basis if certain conditions are met, regardless of the program from which the income tax credits are received. The adoption of this guidance was not material to the Company's financial statements.",

Pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of MUB for a purchase price consisting of $5.5 billion in cash and approximately 44 million shares of common stock of the Company. Under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the purchase price was based on MUB having a tangible book value of $6.25 billion at the closing of the acquisition. At the closing of the acquisition, MUB had $3.5 billion of tangible book value over the $6.25 billion target, consisting of additional cash. The additional cash received is required to be repaid to MUFG on or prior to the fifth anniversary date of the completion of the purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement. As such, it is recognized as debt at the parent company.

This guidance requires additional information in income tax rate reconciliation disclosures and additional disclosures about income taxes paid. The guidance is required, at a minimum, to be adopted on a prospective basis, with an option to apply it retrospectively. The Company expects the adoption of this guidance will not be material to its financial statements.\n\nSegment Reporting \u2014 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance, effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, related to segment disclosures.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from MUB were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. Fair value estimates related to the assets and liabilities from MUB were subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information became available. The Company merged MUB into USBNA during 2023.\n\nIn connection with the transaction, the Company recorded within noninterest expense nonrecurring merger and integration charges of $1.0 billion and $329 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. These expenses were primarily comprised of personnel, legal, advisory and technology related costs.\n\n81\n\nThe following table includes the fair value of consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities from MUB:\n\nDecember 1, 2022 (Dollars in Millions)",

Loan cash flows were generated on an individual loan basis. The probability of default, loss given default, exposure at default and prepayment assumptions were the key factors in determining expected credit losses which were embedded into the estimated cash flows.\n\nCash and Due from Banks The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets.\n\nInvestment Securities Fair value estimates for the investment securities were determined by using quoted market prices for identical securities in active markets when available. For certain securities where quoted market prices were not readily available, the Company utilized a third-party pricing service. The third-party pricing service used a variety of methods that incorporated relevant market data to arrive at an estimate of what a buyer in the marketplace would have paid for these securities under current market conditions. These methods included the use of quoted prices for similar securities, inactive transaction prices and broker quotes, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies.\n\nCore Deposit Benefits This intangible asset represents the economic benefit created by certain client deposit relationships by way of favorable funding relative to alternative sources. The fair value was estimated utilizing the after- tax cost savings method of the income approach. Appropriate consideration was given to deposit costs including cost of funds, net maintenance costs or servicing costs, client retention and alternative funding source costs at the time of acquisition. The discount rate used was derived taking into account the estimated cost of equity, risk-free return rate and risk premium for the market and specific risk related to the asset's cash flows.\n\nOther Assets Included in other assets are tax-advantaged investments promoting affordable housing. The fair value of these investments was estimated based on the value of the expected future benefits.\n\nLoans Held for Sale Fair value estimates for loans held for sale were valued based on quoted market prices, where available, and by comparison to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles.\n\nDeposits and Borrowed Funds The fair values for deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt were estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities.\n\nLoans Fair value estimates for loans were based on discounted cash flow methodologies that considered credit loss and prepayment expectations, market interest rates\n\n83\n\nThe following table presents financial results of MUB included in the Consolidated Statement of Income from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022.",

        "text": "The Company conducts a regular assessment of its available-for-sale investment securities with unrealized losses to determine whether all or some portion of a security's unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. If the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell an investment security, the amortized cost of the security is written down to fair value. When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers various factors such as the nature of the investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent\n\nof the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of underlying collateral, the existence of any government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. The Company measures the allowance for credit losses using market information where available and discounting the cash flows at the original effective rate of the investment security. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted each period through earnings and can be subsequently recovered. The allowance for credit losses on the Company's available-for-sale investment securities was immaterial at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, certain investment securities had a fair value below amortized cost. The following table shows the gross unrealized losses excluding portfolio basis adjustments and fair value of the Company's available-for-sale investment securities with unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of the individual investment securities have been in continuous unrealized loss positions, at December 31, 2023:",

The majority of the Company\u2019s financial asset transfers are residential mortgage loan sales primarily to GSEs, transfers of tax-advantaged investments, commercial loan sales through participation agreements, and other individual or portfolio loan and securities sales. In accordance with the accounting guidance for asset transfers, the Company considers any ongoing involvement with transferred assets in determining whether the assets can be derecognized from the balance sheet. Guarantees provided to certain third parties in connection with the transfer of assets are further discussed in Note 23.\n\nother asset securitizations or similar asset-backed financing arrangements that are off-balance sheet.\n\nThe Company previously provided financial support primarily through the use of waivers of trust and investment management fees associated with various unconsolidated registered money market funds it manages. The Company discontinued providing this support beginning in the third quarter of 2022 due to rising interest rates in 2022. The Company provided $65 million and $250 million of support to the funds during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nFor loans sold under participation agreements, the Company also considers whether the terms of the loan participation agreement meet the accounting definition of a participating interest. With the exception of servicing and certain performance-based guarantees, the Company\u2019s continuing involvement with financial assets sold is minimal and generally limited to market customary representation and warranty clauses. Any gain or loss on sale depends on the previous carrying amount of the transferred financial assets, the consideration received, and any liabilities incurred in exchange for the transferred assets. Upon transfer, any servicing assets and other interests that continue to be held by the Company are initially recognized at fair value. For further information on MSRs, refer to Note 10. On a limited basis, the Company may acquire and package high-grade corporate bonds for select corporate customers, in which the Company generally has no continuing involvement with these transactions. Additionally, the Company is an authorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a regular basis. The Company has no\n\nThe Company is involved in various entities that are considered to be VIEs. The Company's investments in VIEs are primarily related to investments promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy sources. Some of these tax-advantaged investments support the Company's regulatory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Company's investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. These tax credits are recognized as a reduction of tax expense or, for investments qualifying as investment tax credits, as a reduction to the related investment asset. The Company recognized federal and state income tax credits related to its affordable housing and other tax-advantaged investments in tax expense of $576 million, $461 million and $508 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company also recognized $318 million, $527 million and $418 million of investment tax credits for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company recognized $582 million, $424\n\n96 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\n2022",

The majority of the assets of these consolidated VIEs are reported in other assets, and the liabilities are reported in long-term debt and other liabilities. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The Company\u2019s exposure to the consolidated VIEs is generally limited to the carrying value of its variable interests plus any related tax credits previously recognized or transferred to others with a guarantee.\n\nIn addition, the Company sponsors a municipal bond securities tender option bond program. The Company controls the activities of the program\u2019s entities, is entitled to the residual returns and provides liquidity and remarketing arrangements to the program. As a result, the Company has consolidated the program\u2019s entities. At December 31, 2023, $607 million of available-for-sale investment securities and $381 million of short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were related to the tender option bond program, compared with $1.5 billion of available-for-sale investment securities and $1.0 billion of short-term borrowings at December 31, 2022.\n\n97",

        "text": "Regulatory Capital The Company uses certain measures defined by bank regulatory agencies to assess its capital. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under standardized approach.\n\nTier 1 capital is considered core capital and includes common shareholders\u2019 equity adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included in other comprehensive income (loss) (\u201ccommon equity tier 1 capital\u201d), plus qualifying preferred stock, trust preferred securities and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries subject to certain limitations. Total risk-based capital includes Tier 1 capital and other items such as subordinated debt and the allowance for credit losses. Capital measures are stated as a percentage of risk- weighted assets, which are measured based on their perceived credit risks and include certain off-balance sheet\n\nthe\n\nexposures, such as unfunded loan commitments, letters of credit, and derivative contracts. Beginning in 2022, the Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative deferred impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases over the past two years. This cumulative deferred impact will be phased into the Company's regulatory capital through 2024, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025.\n\nThe Company is also subject to leverage ratio requirements, which is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of adjusted average assets under the standardized approach and Tier 1 capital as a percentage of total on- and off- balance sheet leverage exposure under more risk-sensitive advanced approaches.\n\nStatement \u2018of Income\n\n105\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the regulatory capital requirements in effect, along with the actual components and ratios for the Company and its bank subsidiaries, at December 31:",

Banks and financial services holding companies must maintain minimum capital levels, including a stress capital buffer requirement, to avoid limitations on capital distributions and certain discretionary compensation payments. (c) A minimum \"well-capitalized\u201d threshold does not apply to U.S. Bancorp for this ratio as it is not formally defined under applicable banking regulations for bank holding companies.\n\nNoncontrolling interests principally represent third-party investors\u2019 interests in consolidated entities, including preferred stock of consolidated subsidiaries. During 2006, the Company\u2019s banking subsidiary formed USB Realty Corp., a real estate investment trust, for the purpose of issuing 5,000 shares of Fixed-to- Floating Rate Exchangeable Non-cumulative Perpetual Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share (\u201cSeries A Preferred Securities\u201d) to third-party investors. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Securities, if declared, will accrue and be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per annum equal to 1.147 percent above three-month CME Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.26161 percent. Prior to July 1, 2023, dividends for the Series A Preferred Securities were calculated based on LIBOR. On July 1, 2023, the interest rate on these securities transitioned from a LIBOR-based rate to a SOFR-based rate, including a credit spread adjustment, pursuant to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. If USB\n\nRealty Corp. has not declared a dividend on the Series A Preferred Securities before the dividend payment date for any dividend period, such dividend shall not be cumulative and shall cease to accrue and be payable, and USB Realty Corp. will have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for such dividend period, whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred Securities are declared for any future dividend period.\n\nThe Series A Preferred Securities will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of USB Realty Corp. on each fifth anniversary after the dividend payment date occurring in January 2012. Any redemption will be subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d). During 2016, the Company purchased 500 shares of the Series A Preferred Securities held by third-party investors. As of December 31, 2023, 4,500 shares of the Series A Preferred Securities remain outstanding.\n\n106 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report",

The Company determines its expected long-term rates of return reflecting current economic conditions and plan assets.\n\n(b) Determined on an active liability-weighted basis.\n\n%\n\n109\n\nInvestment Policies and Asset Allocation In establishing its investment policies and asset allocation strategies, the Company considers expected returns and the volatility associated with different strategies. An independent consultant performs modeling that projects numerous outcomes using a broad range of possible scenarios, including a mix of possible rates of inflation and economic growth. Starting with current economic information, the model bases its projections on past relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity returns when these types of economic conditions have existed over the previous 30 years, both in the United States and in foreign countries. Estimated future returns and other actuarially determined adjustments are also considered in calculating the estimated return on assets.\n\nGenerally, based on historical performance of the various investment asset classes, investments in equities have outperformed other investment classes but are subject to higher volatility. In an effort to minimize volatility, while recognizing the long-term up-side potential of investing in equities, the Committee has determined that a target asset allocation of 35 percent long duration bonds, 30 percent global equities, 10 percent real assets, 10 percent private equity funds, 5 percent domestic mid-small cap equities, 5 percent emerging markets equities, and 5 percent hedge funds is appropriate.\n\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, plan assets included an asset management arrangement with a related party totaling $62.6 million and $87.8 million, respectively.\n\nIn accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, the Company groups plan assets into a three-level hierarchy for valuation techniques used to measure their fair value based on whether the valuation inputs are observable or unobservable. Refer to Note 22 for further discussion on these levels.\n\nThe assets of the qualified pension plans include investments in equity and U.S. Treasury securities whose fair values are determined based on quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The qualified pension plans also invest in U.S. agency, corporate and municipal debt securities, which are all valued based on observable market prices or data by third party pricing services, and mutual funds which are valued based on quoted net asset values provided by the trustee of the fund; these assets are classified as Level 2. Additionally, the qualified pension plans invest in certain assets that are valued based on net asset values as a practical expedient, including investments in collective investment funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds; the net asset values are provided by the fund trustee or administrator and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe following table summarizes qualified pension plans investment assets measured at fair value at December 31:",

The plan provides for grants of options to purchase shares of common stock at a fixed price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Option grants are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. In addition, the plan provides for grants of shares of common stock or stock units that are subject to restriction on transfer prior to vesting. Most stock and unit awards vest\n\nover three to five years and are subject to forfeiture if certain vesting requirements are not met. Stock incentive plans of acquired companies are generally terminated at the merger closing dates. Participants under such plans receive the Company's common stock, options to buy the Company's common stock, or long term cash incentives, based on the conversion terms of the various merger agreements.

On an ongoing basis, the Company is subject to examinations by federal, state, local and foreign taxing\n\nauthorities that may give rise to differing interpretations of these complex laws, regulations and methods.

A substantial portion of these carryforwards relate to state-only net operating losses, for which the related deferred tax asset is subject to a full valuation allowance as the carryforwards are not expected to be realized within the carryforward period. Management has determined it is more likely than not the other net deferred tax assets could be realized through carry back to taxable income in prior years, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, retained earnings included approximately $102 million of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions, for which no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized. These base year reserves would be recaptured if certain subsidiaries of the Company cease to qualify as a bank for federal income tax purposes. The base year reserves also remain subject to income tax penalty provisions that, in general, require recapture upon certain stock redemptions of, and excess distributions to, stockholders.\n\nIn addition, the Company has $1.3 billion of federal credit carryforwards which expire at various times through 2043 which are not subject to a valuation allowance as management believes that it is more likely than not that the credits will be utilized within the carryforward period.\n\n115",

        "text": "NOTE 2 Derivative Instruments\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to accommodate the business requirements of its customers. The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value in other assets or in other liabilities. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, the derivative is designated as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, net investment hedge, or a designation is not made as it is a customer-related transaction, an economic hedge for asset/liability risk management purposes or another stand-alone derivative created through the Company's operations (\u201cfree-standing derivative\u201d). When a derivative is designated as a fair value, cash flow or net investment hedge, the Company performs an assessment, at inception and, at a minimum, quarterly thereafter, to determine the effectiveness of the derivative in offsetting changes in the value or cash flows of the hedged item(s).\n\nFair Value Hedges These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes of its underlying available-for-sale investment securities and fixed-rate debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges, and changes in the fair value of the hedged items, are recorded in earnings.\n\nCash Flow Hedges These derivatives are interest rate swaps the Company uses to hedge the forecasted cash flows from its underlying variable-rate loans and debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) until the cash flows of the hedged items are realized. If a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss in other comprehensive income (loss) is amortized to earnings over the period the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings. If a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is ceased and any gain or loss included in other comprehensive income (loss) is reported in earnings immediately, unless the forecasted transaction is at least reasonably possible of occurring, whereby the amounts remain within other comprehensive income (loss). At December 31, 2023, the Company had $242 million (net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), compared with $114 million (net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized losses at December 31, 2022. The estimated amount to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the next 12 months is a loss of\n\n116 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\n$78 million (net-of-tax). All cash flow hedges were highly effective for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.\n\nNet Investment Hedges The Company uses forward commitments to sell specified amounts of certain foreign currencies, and non-derivative debt instruments, to hedge the volatility of its net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The carrying amount of non-derivative debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.",

These derivatives include forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans, which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk related to MLHFS and unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The Company also enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to economically hedge the change in the fair value of the Company's MSRs. The Company enters into foreign currency forwards to economically hedge remeasurement gains and losses the Company recognizes on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Company also enters into interest rate swaps as economic hedges of fair value option elected deposits. In addition, the Company acts as a seller and buyer of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity contracts for its customers. The Company mitigates the market and liquidity risk associated with these customer derivatives by entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially fully offset the exposure to earnings from these customer-related positions. The Company\u2019s customer derivatives and related hedges are monitored and reviewed by the Company\u2019s Market Risk Committee, which establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company also has derivative contracts that are created through its operations, including certain unfunded mortgage loan commitments and swap agreements related to the sale a portion of its Class B common and preferred shares of Visa Inc. Refer to Note 23 for further information on these swap agreements. The Company uses credit derivatives to economically hedge the credit risk on its derivative positions and loan portfolios.",

        "text": "Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts. The Company measures that credit risk using a credit valuation adjustment and includes it within the fair value of the derivative. The Company manages counterparty credit risk through diversification of its derivative positions among various counterparties, by entering into derivative positions that are centrally cleared through clearinghouses, by entering into master netting arrangements and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. A master netting arrangement allows two counterparties, who have multiple derivative contracts with each other, the ability to net settle amounts under all contracts, including any related collateral, through a single payment and in a single currency. Collateral arrangements generally require the counterparty to deliver collateral (typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency securities) equal to the Company's net derivative receivable, subject to minimum transfer and credit rating requirements.\n\nThe Company's collateral arrangements are predominately bilateral and, therefore, contain provisions that require collateralization of the Company's net liability derivative positions. Required collateral coverage is based on net liability thresholds and may be contingent upon the Company's credit rating from two of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below credit ratings thresholds established in the collateral arrangements, the counterparties to the derivatives could request immediate additional collateral coverage up to and including full collateral coverage for derivatives in a net liability position. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives under collateral arrangements that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2023, was $2.0 billion. At December 31, 2023, the Company had $1.7 billion of cash posted as collateral against this net liability position.\n\n120 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\n2021\n\n1\n\n7\n\n5\n\n(5)\n\n3\n\n1\n\n(7)",

        "text": "Netting Arrangements for Certain Financial Instruments and Securities Financing Activities\n\nThe Company's derivative portfolio consists of bilateral over-the-counter trades, certain interest rate derivatives and credit contracts required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses per current regulations, and exchange-traded positions which may include U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures or options on U.S. Treasury futures. Of the Company's $1.2 trillion total notional amount of derivative positions at December 31, 2023, $548.9 billion related to bilateral over-the-counter trades, $660.4 billion related to those centrally cleared through clearinghouses and $1.9 billion related to those that were exchange-traded. The Company\u2019s derivative contracts typically include offsetting rights (referred to as netting arrangements), and depending on expected volume, credit risk, and counterparty preference, collateral maintenance may be required. For all derivatives under collateral support arrangements, fair value is determined daily and, depending on the collateral maintenance requirements, the Company and a counterparty may receive or deliver collateral, based upon the net fair value of all derivative positions between the Company and the counterparty. Collateral is typically cash, but securities may be allowed under collateral arrangements with certain counterparties. Receivables and payables related to cash collateral are included in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with the related derivative asset and liability fair values. Any securities pledged to counterparties as collateral remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities received from counterparties as collateral are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In general, securities used as collateral can be sold, repledged or otherwise used by the party in possession. No restrictions exist on the use of cash collateral by either party. Refer to Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's derivatives, including collateral arrangements.\n\nAs part of the Company's treasury and broker-dealer operations, the Company executes transactions that are treated as securities sold under agreements to repurchase or securities purchased under agreements to resell, both of\n\nwhich are accounted for as collateralized financings. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase include repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions. Securities purchased under agreements to resell include reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions. For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Company records a liability for the cash received, which is included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Company records a receivable for the cash paid, which is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.",

Derivatives, trading and available-for-sale investment securities, MSRs, certain time deposits and substantially all MLHFS are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held for sale, loans held for investment and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower-of-cost-or-fair value accounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets. Other financial instruments, such as held-to- maturity investment securities, loans, the majority of time deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt, are accounted for at amortized cost. See \u201cFair Value of Financial Instruments\u2019 in this Note for further information on the estimated fair value of these other financial instruments. In accordance with disclosure guidance, certain financial instruments, such as deposits with no defined or contractual maturity, receivables and payables due in one year or less, insurance contracts and equity investments not accounted for at fair value, are excluded from this Note. In addition, refer to Note 3 regarding the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in the MUB acquisition.\n\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A fair value measurement reflects all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique, the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance.\n\nThe Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value into three-level hierarchy for valuation techniques used to measure financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. This hierarchy is based on whether the valuation inputs are observable or unobservable. These levels are:",

        "text": "Valuation Methodologies\n\nThe valuation methodologies used by the Company to measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value are described below. In addition, the following section includes an indication of the level of the fair value hierarchy in which the assets or liabilities are classified. Where appropriate, the descriptions include information about the valuation models and key inputs to those models. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were no significant changes to the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure fair value.\n\nAvailable-For-Sale Investment Securities When quoted market prices for identical securities are available in an active market, these prices are used to determine fair value and these securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 investment securities include U.S. Treasury and exchange-traded securities.\n\nFor other securities, quoted market prices may not be readily available for the specific securities. When possible, the Company determines fair value based on market observable information, including quoted market prices for similar securities, inactive transaction prices, and broker quotes. These securities are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 valuations are generally provided by a third-party pricing service. Level 2 investment securities are predominantly agency mortgage-backed securities, certain other asset-backed securities, obligations of state and political subdivisions and agency debt securities.\n\nMortgage Loans Held For Sale MLHFS measured at fair value, for which an active secondary market and readily available market prices exist, are initially valued at the transaction price and are subsequently valued by comparison to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. MLHFS are classified within Level 2. Included in mortgage banking revenue were net losses of $46 million, $450 million and $145 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, from the changes to fair value of these MLHFS under fair value option accounting guidance. Changes in fair value due to instrument specific credit risk were immaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is measured based on contractual\n\ninterest rates and reported as interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in fair value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting.\n\nTime Deposits The Company elects the fair value option to account for certain time deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Electing to measure these time deposits at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in fair value of these deposits with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them. The time deposits measured at fair value are valued using a discounted cash flow model that utilizes market observable inputs and are classified within Level 2. Included in interest expense on deposits were net gains of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from the changes in fair value of time deposits under fair value option accounting guidance.",

        "text": "Mortgage Servicing Rights MSRs are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology, and are classified within Level 3. The Company determines fair value of the MSRs by projecting future cash flows for different interest rate scenarios using prepayment rates and other assumptions, and discounts these cash flows using a risk adjusted rate based on option adjusted spread levels. There is minimal observable market activity for MSRs on comparable portfolios and, therefore, the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment. Refer to Note 10 for further information on MSR valuation assumptions.\n\nDerivatives The majority of derivatives held by the Company are executed over-the-counter or centrally cleared through clearinghouses and are valued using market standard cash flow valuation techniques. The models incorporate inputs, depending on the type of derivative, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and volatility. All derivative values incorporate an assessment of the risk of counterparty nonperformance, measured based on the Company's evaluation of credit risk including external assessments of credit risk. The Company monitors and manages its nonperformance risk by considering its ability to net derivative positions under master netting arrangements, as well as collateral received or provided under collateral arrangements. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure the fair value of derivatives, at a counterparty level, on a net basis. The majority of the derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as the significant inputs to the models, including nonperformance risk, are observable. However, certain derivative transactions are with counterparties where risk of nonperformance cannot be observed in the market and, therefore, the credit valuation adjustments result in these derivatives being classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe Company also has other derivative contracts that are created through its operations, including commitments\n\nto purchase and originate mortgage loans and swap agreements executed in conjunction with the sale of a portion of its Class B common and preferred shares of Visa Inc. (the \u201cVisa swaps\u201d). The mortgage loan commitments are valued by pricing models that include market observable and unobservable inputs, which result in the commitments being classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The unobservable inputs include assumptions about the percentage of commitments that actually become a closed loan and the MSR value that is inherent in the underlying loan value. The Visa swaps require payments by either the Company or the purchaser of the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares when there are changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Inc. Class B common and preferred shares to Visa Inc. Class A common and preferred shares, respectively, as well as quarterly payments to the purchaser based on specified terms of the agreements. Management reviews and updates the Visa swaps fair value in conjunction with its review of Visa Inc. related litigation contingencies, and the associated escrow funding. The expected litigation resolution impacts the Visa Inc. Class B common share to Visa Inc. Class Acommon share conversion rate, as well as the ultimate termination date for the Visa swaps. Accordingly, the Visa swaps are classified within Level 3. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the Visa Inc. restructuring and related card association litigation.",

This section includes a description of the significant inputs used by the Company and a description of any interrelationships between these inputs. The discussion below excludes nonrecurring fair value measurements of collateral value used for impairment measures for loans and OREO. These valuations utilize third party appraisal or broker price opinions, and are classified as Level 3 due to the significant judgment involved.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company's MSRs are expected prepayments and the option adjusted spread that is added to the risk-free rate to discount projected cash flows. Significant increases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value measurement. There is no direct interrelationship between prepayments and option adjusted spread. Prepayment rates generally move in the opposite direction of market interest rates. Option adjusted spread is generally impacted by changes in market return requirements.\n\n125\n\nThe following table shows the significant valuation assumption ranges for MSRs at December 31, 2023:",

An increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the related litigation would have resulted in an increase in the derivative liability.

        "text": "Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities\n\nVisa Restructuring and Card Association Litigation The Company's Payment Services business issues credit and debit cards and acquires credit and debit card transactions through the Visa U.S.A. Inc. card association or its affiliates (collectively \u201cVisa\u201d). In 2007, Visa completed a restructuring and issued shares of Visa Inc. common stock to its financial institution members in contemplation of its initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) completed in the first quarter of 2008 (the \u201cVisa Reorganization\u201d). As a part of the Visa Reorganization, the Company received its proportionate number of shares of Visa Inc. common stock, which were subsequently converted to Class B shares of Visa Inc. (\u201cClass B shares\u201d). As of December 31, 2023, the Company has sold substantially all of its Class B shares.\n\nVisa U.S.A. Inc. (\u201cVisa U.S.A.\u201d) and MasterCard International (collectively, the \u201cCard Brands\u201d) are defendants in antitrust lawsuits challenging the practices of the Card Brands (the \u201cVisa Litigation\u201d). Visa U.S.A. member banks have a contingent obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. under the Visa U.S.A. bylaws (which were modified at the time of the restructuring in October 2007) for potential losses arising from the Visa Litigation. The indemnification by the Visa U.S.A. member banks has no specific maximum amount. Using proceeds from its IPO and through reductions to the conversion ratio applicable to the Class B shares held by Visa U.S.A. member banks, Visa Inc. has funded an escrow account for the benefit of member financial institutions to fund their indemnification obligations associated with the Visa Litigation. The receivable related to the escrow account is classified in other liabilities and fully offsets the related Visa Litigation contingent liability.\n\nIn October 2012, Visa signed a settlement agreement to resolve class action claims associated with the multidistrict interchange litigation pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the \u201cMulti- District Litigation\u201d). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the approval of that settlement and remanded the matter to the district court. Thereafter, the case was split into two putative class actions, one seeking damages (the \u201cDamages Action\u201d) and a separate class action seeking injunctive relief only (the \u201cInjunctive Action\u201d). In September 2018, Visa signed a new settlement agreement, superseding the original settlement agreement, to resolve the Damages Action. The Damages Action settlement has received final court approval and is now resolved. The Injunctive Action, which generally seeks changes to Visa rules, is still pending.\n\nCommitments to Extend Credit Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The contractual amount represents the Company\u2019s exposure to credit loss, in the event of default by the borrower. The Company manages this credit risk by using the same credit policies it applies to\n\n130 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\n$489 million and $498 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The carrying value of other guarantees was $198 million and $241 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nloans. Collateral is obtained to secure commitments based on management's credit assessment of the borrower.

The guarantees frequently support\n\npublic and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuances, bond financings and other similar transactions. The Company also issues and confirms commercial letters of credit on behalf of customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with trade transactions. In the event of a customer's or counterparty\u2019s nonperformance, the Company's credit loss exposure is similar to that in any extension of credit, up to the letter\u2019s contractual amount. Management assesses the borrower's credit to determine the necessary collateral, which may include marketable securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate. Since the conditions requiring the Company to fund letters of credit may not occur, the Company expects its liquidity requirements to be less than the total outstanding commitments. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under standby letter of credit arrangements at December 31, 2023, were approximately $11.0 billion with a weighted-average term of approximately 16 months. The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit was approximately $20 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe contract or notional amount of letters of credit at December 31, 2023, were as follows:",

For certain guarantees, the Company has recorded a liability related to the potential obligation, or has access to collateral to support the guarantee or through the exercise of other recourse provisions can offset some or all of the maximum potential future payments made under these guarantees.\n\nThird Party Borrowing Arrangements The Company provides guarantees to third parties as a part of certain subsidiaries\u2019 borrowing arrangements. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $5 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nCommitments from Securities Lending The Company participates in securities lending activities by acting as the customer's agent involving the loan of securities. The Company indemnifies customers for the difference between the fair value of the securities lent and the fair value of the collateral received. Cash collateralizes these transactions. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $6.7 billion at December 31, 2023, and represent the fair\n\nvalue of the securities lent to third parties. At December 31, 2023, the Company held $6.9 billion of cash as collateral for these arrangements.\n\nAsset Sales The Company has provided guarantees to certain third parties in connection with the sale or syndication of certain assets, primarily loan portfolios and tax-advantaged investments. These guarantees are generally in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole provisions that are triggered upon a credit event or a change in the tax-qualifying status of the related projects, as applicable, and remain in effect until the loans are collected or final tax credits are realized, respectively. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $10.3 billion at December 31, 2023, and represented the proceeds received from the buyer or the guaranteed portion in these transactions where the buy-back or make- whole provisions have not yet expired. At December 31, 2023, the Company had reserved $93 million for potential losses related to the sale or syndication of tax-advantaged investments.\n\nThe maximum potential future payments do not include loan sales where the Company provides standard representation and warranties to the buyer against losses related to loan underwriting documentation defects that may have existed at the time of sale that generally are identified after the occurrence of a triggering event such as delinquency. For these types of loan sales, the maximum potential future payments is generally the unpaid principal balance of loans sold measured at the end of the current reporting period. Actual losses will be significantly less than the maximum exposure, as only a fraction of loans sold will have a representation and warranty breach, and any losses on repurchase would generally be mitigated by any collateral held against the loans.",

        "text": "The Company regularly sells loans to GSEs as part of its mortgage banking activities. The Company provides customary representations and warranties to GSEs in conjunction with these sales. These representations and warranties generally require the Company to repurchase assets if it is subsequently determined that a loan did not meet specified criteria, such as a documentation deficiency or rescission of mortgage insurance. If the Company is unable to cure or refute a repurchase request, the Company is generally obligated to repurchase the loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for losses. At December 31, 2023, the Company had reserved $13 million for potential losses from representation and warranty obligations, compared with $17 million at December 31, 2022. The Company's reserve reflects management's best estimate of losses for representation and warranty obligations. The Company\u2019s repurchase reserve is modeled at the loan level, taking into consideration the individual credit quality and borrower activity that has transpired since origination. The model applies credit quality and economic tisk factors to derive a probability of default and potential repurchase that are based on the Company's historical loss experience, and estimates loss severity based on expected collateral value. The Company also considers qualitative factors that may result in anticipated losses differing from historical loss trends.\n\n131\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $18 million and $39 million, respectively, of unresolved representation and warranty claims from GSEs. The Company does not have a significant amount of unresolved claims from investors other than GSEs.\n\nMerchant Processing The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides merchant processing services. Under the rules of credit card associations, a merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit card transactions processed. This contingent liability arises in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder's favor. In this situation, the transaction is \u201ccharged-back\u201d to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the Company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder.\n\nAcardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until the later of up to four months after the date the transaction is processed or the receipt of the product or service to present a charge-back to the Company as the merchant processor. The absolute maximum potential liability is estimated to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the associations\u2019 requirements to be valid charge-back transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the maximum potential exposure for charge-backs would approximate the total amount of merchant transactions processed through the credit card associations for the last four months. For the last four months of 2023 this amount totaled approximately $140.3 billion. In most cases, this contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants. However, where the product or service has been purchased but is not provided until a future date (\u201cfuture delivery\u201d), the potential for this contingent liability increases. To mitigate this risk, the Company may require the merchant to make an escrow deposit, place maximum volume limitations on future delivery transactions processed by the merchant at any point in time, or require various credit enhancements (including letters of credit and bank guarantees). Also, merchant processing contracts may include event triggers to provide the Company more financial and operational control in the event of financial deterioration of the merchant.",

        "text": "The Company currently processes card transactions in the United States, Canada and Europe through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the event a merchant was unable to fulfill product or services subject to future delivery, such as airline tickets, the Company could become financially liable for refunding the purchase price of such products or services purchased through the credit card associations under the charge-back provisions. Charge-back risk related to these merchants is evaluated in a manner similar to credit risk assessments and, as such, merchant processing contracts contain various provisions to protect the Company in the event of default. At December 31, 2023, the value of airline tickets purchased to be delivered at a future date through card transactions processed by the Company was $13.1 billion. The Company held collateral of $679 million in escrow deposits, letters of credit and indemnities from\n\n132 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nfinancial institutions, and liens on various assets. In addition to specific collateral or other credit enhancements, the Company maintains a liability for its implied guarantees associated with future delivery. At December 31, 2023, the liability was $50 million primarily related to these airline processing arrangements.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has unresolved charge- backs. The Company assesses the likelihood of its potential liability based on the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical loss experience. At December 31, 2023, the Company held $135 million of merchant escrow deposits as collateral and had a recorded liability for potential losses of $21 million.\n\nTender Option Bond Program Guarantee As discussed in Note 8, the Company sponsors a municipal bond securities tender option bond program and consolidates the program\u2019s entities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company provides financial performance guarantees related to the program's entities. At December 31, 2023, the Company guaranteed $589 million of borrowings of the program\u2019s entities, included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in short-term borrowings. The Company also included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet the related $607 million of available-for-sale investment securities serving as collateral for this arrangement.\n\nOther Guarantees and Commitments As of December 31, 2023, the Company sponsored, and owned 100 percent of the common equity of, USB Capital IX, a wholly-owned unconsolidated trust, formed for the purpose of issuing redeemable Income Trust Securities (\u201cITS\u201d) to third-party investors, originally investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debt securities (\u201cDebentures\u201d) issued by the Company and entering into stock purchase contracts to purchase the Company's preferred stock in the future. As of December 31, 2023, all of the Debentures issued by the Company have either matured or been retired. Total assets of USB Capital IX were $686 million at December 31, 2023, consisting primarily of the Company\u2019s Series A Preferred Stock. The Company's obligations under the transaction documents, taken together, have the effect of providing a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company, on a junior subordinated basis, of the payment obligations of the trust to third-party investors totaling $685 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company has also made other financial performance guarantees and commitments primarily related to the operations of its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2023, the maximum potential future payments guaranteed or committed by the Company under these arrangements were approximately $2.0 billion.",

        "text": "Litigation and Regulatory Matters\n\nThe Company is subject to various litigation and regulatory matters that arise from the conduct of its business activities. The Company establishes reserves for such matters when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes the ultimate resolution of existing legal and regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of\n\noperations or cash flows of the Company. However, in light of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations for a particular period, and future changes in circumstances or additional information could result in additional accruals or resolution in excess of established accruals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, potentially materially.\n\nResidential Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation Starting in 2011, the Company and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee for residential mortgage-backed securities trusts for losses arising out of the 2008 financial crisis. In the lawsuits brought against the Company, the investors allege that the Company's banking subsidiary, USBNA, as trustee caused them to incur substantial losses by failing to enforce loan repurchase obligations and failing to abide by appropriate standards of care after events of default allegedly occurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek monetary damages in unspecified amounts and most also seek equitable relief.\n\nRegulatory Matters The Company is continually subject to examinations, inquiries, investigations and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry or scrutiny covering a wide range of issues in its financial services businesses including in areas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such as compliance, risk management, third-party risk management and consumer protection. In some cases, these matters are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at the Company individually. For example, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC has been investigating U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (\u201cUSBFS\u201d), a subsidiary of USBNA, relating to its role providing fund administration services to a third-party investment fund. This investment fund was advised by an investment adviser who engaged in fraud, and USBFS was not affiliated with the investment adviser and did not provide any advisory services to the fund. The Division of Enforcement has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against USBFS, and USBFS is in the process of responding to the SEC on this matter. The Company is cooperating fully with",

These operating segments are components of the Company about which financial information is prepared and is evaluated regularly by management in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company has the following reportable operating segments:\n\nWealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking provides core banking, specialized lending, transaction and payment processing, capital markets, asset management, and brokerage and investment related\n\nall pending examinations, inquiries and investigations, any of which could lead to administrative or legal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in these proceedings or settlements may include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in the Company's business practices (which may increase the Company's operating expenses and decrease its revenue).\n\nOn December 19, 2023, USBNA agreed to the issuance of consent orders with the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) resolving the previously disclosed investigations of the Company's administration of unemployment insurance benefit prepaid debit cards during the pandemic timeframe. Also, on February 9, 2024, the SEC announced a settlement with U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., resolving the previously disclosed inquiry regarding record retention requirements relating to electronic business communications. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) has conducted an inquiry concerning similar issues and the Company is currently in resolution discussions with the CFTC on that matter. The financial impact of the resolution of these matters was not material to the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and the anticipated resolution of the CFTC matter is also not expected to be material.\n\nOutlook Due to their complex nature, it can be years before litigation and regulatory matters are resolved. The Company may be unable to develop an estimate or range of loss where matters are in early stages, there are significant factual or legal issues to be resolved, damages are unspecified or uncertain, or there is uncertainty as to a litigation class being certified or the outcome of pending motions, appeals or proceedings. For those litigation and regulatory matters where the Company has information to develop an estimate or range of loss, the Company believes the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses in aggregate, in excess of any reserves established for matters where a loss is considered probable, will not be material to its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company\u2019s estimates are subject to significant judgment and uncertainties, and the matters underlying the estimates will change from time to time. Actual results may vary significantly from the current estimates.\n\nservices to wealth, middle market, large corporate, government and institutional clients.\n\nConsumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small business banking and consumer lending. Products and services are delivered through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, online services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business partners.\n\nPayment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards,\n\n133\n\ncorporate, government and purchasing card services and merchant processing.",

The allowance for credit losses and related provision expense are allocated to the business segments according to the volume and credit quality of the loan balances managed, but with the impact of changes in economic forecasts recorded in Treasury and Corporate Support. Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to the business segments based on the mix of business of an entity acquired by the Company. Within the Company, capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated to the business segments to support evaluation of business performance. Business segments are allocated capital on a risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital requirements. Generally, the determination of the amount of capital allocated to each business segment includes credit allocations following a Basel III regulatory framework. Interest income and expense is determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business segment. Because funding and asset/liability management is a central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business segment assets and liabilities, respectively, using a matched funding concept. Also, each business unit is allocated the taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products. The residual effect on net interest income of asset/liability management activities is included in Treasury\n\n134 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nand Corporate Support. Noninterest income and expenses directly managed by each business segment, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are accounted for within each segment's financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated financial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities by the business segments. Generally, operating losses are charged to the business segment when the loss event is realized in a manner similar to a loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business segments that directly support another business segment\u2019s operations are charged to the applicable business segment based on its utilization of those services, primarily measured by the volume of customer activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest expense. Certain activities that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance are not charged to the business segments. The income or expenses associated with these corporate activities, including merger and integration charges, are reported within the Treasury and Corporate Support business segment. Income taxes are assessed to each business segment at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.",

Federal law requires loans to the Company or its affiliates to be secured and generally limits loans to the Company or an individual affiliate to 10 percent of each bank\u2019s unimpaired capital and surplus.

        "text": "Risk Factors\n\nAn investment in the Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. Below are material risk factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky.\n\nEconomic and Market Conditions Risk\n\nDeterioration in business and economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s lending business and the value of loans and debt securities it holds The Company's business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and abroad, including factors such as the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets, the strength of the domestic and global economies in which the Company operates, and customer deposit behavior. These conditions can change suddenly and negatively. For example, changes in these conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the Company's consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios, its level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, and its results of operations from the start of the pandemic in early 2020 through 2022, and changes in these conditions caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine impacted the Company's results of operations in 2022 and 2023. Inflation continued to impact the Company's financial condition in 2023, as the COVID-19 era fiscal and monetary stimulus as well as geopolitical pressures continued to drive inflationary pressure. Further, recent bank failures prompted by sudden and significant withdrawals of deposits at the failing banks resulted in significant volatility in the stock prices of certain financial services institutions. In addition, volatility due to failures of other banks or general uncertainty regarding the health of banks may affect customer deposit behavior and cause deposit withdrawals. Other future changes in these conditions, whether related to a pandemic, the war in Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, the threat or occurrence of a U.S. sovereign default or government shutdown, disruptions in the financial services industry or otherwise, could have additional adverse effects on the Company and its businesses.\n\nGiven the high percentage of the Company's assets represented directly or indirectly by loans, and the\n\nimportance of lending to its overall business, weak economic conditions have in the past negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, the Company's business and results of operations, including new loan origination activity, existing loan utilization rates and delinquencies, defaults and the ability of customers to meet obligations under the loans. In addition, future deterioration in economic conditions could have adverse effects on loan origination activity, loan utilization rates and delinquencies, defaults and the ability of customers to meet loan obligations. The value to the Company of other assets such as investment securities, most of which are debt securities or other financial instruments supported by loans, similarly have been, and would be, negatively impacted by widespread decreases in credit quality resulting from a weakening of the economy.",

        "text": "In addition, volatility and uncertainty related to inflation or a possible recession and their effects, which could potentially continue to contribute to poor economic conditions, may contribute to or enhance some of the risks described herein. For example, higher inflation, slower growth or a recession could reduce demand for the Company's products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of its borrowers or result in lower values for its interest- earning assets and investment securities. In 2023, demand for borrowing from both corporate and consumer customers, specifically for residential mortgage and auto loans, slowed as borrowing costs rose due to increased interest rates. Any of these effects, or others that the Company is not able to predict, could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nAny deterioration in global economic conditions could damage the domestic economy or negatively affect the Company's borrowers or other counterparties that have direct or indirect exposure to these regions. Such global disruptions, including disruptions in supply chains or geopolitical risk, can undermine investor confidence, cause a contraction of available credit, or create market volatility, any of which could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, even if the Company's direct exposure to the affected region is limited. Global political trends toward nationalism and isolationism could increase the probability of a deterioration in global economic conditions.\n\nChanges in interest rates have in the past reduced, and could in the future reduce, the Company\u2019s net interest income The Company's earnings are dependent to a large degree on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies. Volatility in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments. Direct investments, such as United States government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles (including mutual funds), generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions because of the absence\n\nof federal insurance premiums. This may cause USBNA to lose some of its low-cost deposit funding. Customers may also continue to move noninterest- bearing deposits into interest-bearing accounts, thus increasing overall deposit costs. Higher funding costs may reduce the Company's net interest margin and net interest income. A prolonged period of high or increasing interest rates may cause the Company to experience an acceleration of deposit migration, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and liquidity. This risk is exacerbated by technological developments and trends in customer behavior, including the ease and speed with which deposits may be transferred electronically, particularly by a growing number of customers who maintain accounts with multiple banks.\n\nUnited States interest rates fell dramatically during the first quarter of 2020 and remained low through 2021, which adversely affected the Company's net interest income. The Federal Reserve Board raised benchmark interest rates throughout 2022 and 2023, and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions, particularly inflationary pressures, or may lower interest rates in future periods.",

        "text": "When interest rates are increasing, the Company can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income, and conversely, decreasing interest rates can adversely impact the Company's net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to fewer originations of loans, less liquidity in the financial markets, and higher funding costs, each of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels. In 2022 and 2023, as a result of the high interest rate environment, the Company earned higher net interest income but experienced fewer originations of mortgage loans and higher funding costs, and the Company expects these effects to continue in the future if interest rates remain elevated or increase further. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing the Company to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.\n\nThe Company\u2019s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which the Company owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that the Company ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that the Company owns or in which it makes markets, which may\n\n141\n\nhave an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. In addition, losses in the value of the Company's investment securities or loan portfolio could affect market perception of the Company and create volatility in the Company's stock price. Losses in the value of the Company's investment securities, even if they do not affect earnings or capital, could also cause some depositors, particularly those who maintain uninsured and uncollateralized deposits, to question the stability of USBNA and to move their deposits away from USBNA. Such events could negatively affect the Company's liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company's risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and control the Company\u2019s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, the Company's hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses in the event of unexpected or unmitigated market volatility.",

Although the Company devotes significant resources to maintain, improve, and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, networks, technologies and intellectual property, and to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Company, its employees, and its customers, the Company\u2019s security measures may not be effective against new threats. Malicious actors continue to develop increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks that could impact the Company. Many financial institutions, retailers and other companies engaged in data processing, including software and information technology service providers, have reported cyber attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of software that is intentionally included or inserted in an information system for a harmful purpose (malware).\n\nAttacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could also adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of the Company's businesses. The increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems increases the risk of operational failure, both for the Company and on an industry-wide basis, and means that a technology failure, cyber attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could materially affect the Company, counterparties or other market participants.\n\n142 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nThird parties that facilitate the Company's business activities, including exchanges, clearinghouses, payment and ATM networks, financial intermediaries and vendors that provide services or technology solutions for the Company's operations, are also sources of operational and security risks to the Company due to operational or technical failures of their systems, misconduct or negligence by their employees or cyber attacks that could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Company, resulting in lost or compromised Company or customer information. Furthermore, a third party may not reveal an attack or system failure to the Company in a timely manner, which could compromise the Company\u2019s ability to respond effectively. Some of these third parties may engage vendors of their own, which introduces the risk that the third party's vendors and subcontractors could be the source of operational and security failures. In addition, if a third party obtains access to the customer account data on the Company\u2019s systems, and that party experiences a breach via an external or internal threat or misappropriates such data, the Company and its customers could suffer material harm, including heightened risk of fraudulent transactions, losses from fraudulent transactions, increased operational costs to remediate any security breach and reputational harm.

        "text": "Within the past several years, multiple companies have disclosed significant cybersecurity breaches affecting debit and credit card accounts of their customers, some of whom were the Company\u2019s cardholders and who may experience fraud on their card accounts because of the breach. The Company has suffered, and will in the future suffer, losses associated with reimbursing its customers for such fraudulent transactions and for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. These attacks involving Company cards are likely to continue and could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\n\nThe Company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all cyberattacks because malicious actor methods and techniques change frequently, increase in sophistication, often are not recognized until launched, sometimes go undetected even when successful, and originate from a wide variety of sources, including organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, hostile foreign governments and other external parties. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to the Company\u2019s data or that of its customers or clients, such as through \u201cphishing\u201d and other social engineering schemes. For example, recent advances in artificial intelligence may allow a bad actor to create so-called \u201cdeep fakes\u201d to impersonate the voice or likeness of another individual, which could be used in social engineering schemes that may be more difficult to detect than other social engineering efforts. Other types of attacks may include the introduction of computer viruses and/or\n\nmalicious or destructive code, denial-of-service attacks (DDoS), and cyber extortion with accompanying ransom demands. The Company\u2019s information security risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile and internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, the Company\u2019s customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smart phones and tablet computers, to make payments and manage their accounts, and are subject to \u201cphishing,\u201d scam websites, and other attempts from cyber criminals to compromise or deny access to their accounts. The Company has limited ability to assure the safety and security of its customers\u2019 transactions with the Company to the extent they are using their own devices, which have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to such threats.\n\nIf the Company's physical or cybersecurity systems are penetrated or circumvented, or an authorized user intentionally or unintentionally removes, loses or destroys critical business data, serious negative consequences for the Company can follow, including significant disruption of the Company's operations, misappropriation of confidential Company and/or customer information, or damage to the Company's, customers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 computers or systems. These consequences could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws; financial loss to the Company or to its customers; loss of confidence in the Company's security measures; customer dissatisfaction; significant litigation exposure; regulatory investigations, fines, penalties or intervention; reimbursement or other compensatory costs (including the costs of credit monitoring services); additional compliance costs; and harm to the Company's reputation, all of which could adversely affect the Company.",

In addition, to the extent the Company\u2019s insurance covers aspects of any breach, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all the Company's losses.\n\nThe Company relies on its employees, systems and third parties to conduct its business, and certain failures by systems or misconduct by employees or third parties could adversely affect its operations The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. The Company's business, financial, accounting, data processing, and other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged due to a number of factors, including events that are out of its control. In addition to the risks posed by information security breaches, as discussed above, such systems could be compromised because of spikes in transaction volume, electrical or telecommunications outages, degradation or loss of internet or website availability, natural disasters, political or social unrest, and terrorist acts. The Company\u2019s business operations may be adversely affected by\n\nsignificant disruption to the operating systems that support its businesses and customers. The Company\u2019s backup systems could become compromised, which could negatively impact the ability to back up data.\n\nThe Company could also incur losses resulting from the risk of human error by employees, misconduct or fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, unauthorized access to its computer systems, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and failures of business continuation and disaster recovery processes and systems. This risk of loss also includes customer remediation costs, potential legal actions, fines or civil money penalties that could arise resulting from an operational deficiency or noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\n\nThird parties provide key components of the Company's business infrastructure, such as internet connections, cloud services, network access and mutual fund distribution. Any problems caused by third-party service providers, including failing to comply with their contractual obligations or performing their services negligently, could adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver products and services to the Company\u2019s customers and otherwise to conduct its business. Replacing third-party service providers could also entail significant delay and expense. In addition, failure of third- party service providers to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company's ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third-party service provider could adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party.",

Any mishandling or misuse of personal information by the Company or its suppliers could expose the Company to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. For example, a state attorney general recently announced an action against a bank for alleged failure to protect consumer accounts from fraud.\n\nIn the United States, several states have enacted consumer privacy laws that impose compliance obligations with respect to personal information. In particular, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and its implementing regulations impose significant requirements on covered businesses with respect to consumer data privacy rights. Compliance with the CCPA and other state statutes, common law, or regulations designed to protect personal information could potentially require substantive technology infrastructure and process changes across many of the Company's businesses. Non-compliance with the CCPA or similar laws and regulations could lead to substantial regulatory fines and penalties, damages from private causes of action, compelled changes to the Company's business practices, and/or reputational harm. The Company cannot predict whether any pending or future state or federal legislation will be adopted, or the impact of any such adopted legislation on the Company. Future legislation could result in substantial costs to the Company and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIn addition, legal requirements for cross-border personal data transfers are constantly changing, including the revisions made by the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) that require the use of revised Standard Contractual Clauses (\u201cSCCs\u201d) for international data transfers from the EEA. The SCCs are required to be used for new agreements involving the cross-border transfer of personal data from the EEA and must be supplemented by an assessment and due diligence of the legal and regulatory landscape of the jurisdiction of the data importer, the channels used to transmit personal data and any sub-processors that may receive personal data. The United Kingdom has developed its own set of SCCs that must be used for transfers of personal data from the United Kingdom to the United States. In July 2023, the European Commission announced a final adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, a cross-border data transfer mechanism that replaced the EU- U.S. Privacy Shield that was invalidated in 2020. Compliance with this changing landscape of privacy requirements could potentially compel the Company to make significant technological and operational changes, any of which could result in substantial costs to the Company, and failure to comply with applicable data transfer or privacy requirements could subject the Company to fines or regulatory investigation or oversight.\n\nAdditional risks could arise from the failure of the Company or third parties to provide adequate notice to the Company\u2019s customers about the personal information\n\n144 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report",

Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Company's measures to safeguard personal information and abide by privacy preferences, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate or that the Company does not abide by such privacy preferences, could cause the Company to lose existing or potential customers and thereby reduce its revenues. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by the Company to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, and/or in material liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions. Refer to \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding data privacy laws and regulations. Any of these outcomes could materially damage the Company's reputation and otherwise adversely affect its business.\n\nThe Company could lose market share and experience increased costs if it does not effectively develop and implement new technology The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, including innovative ways that customers can make payments or manage their accounts, such as through the use of mobile payments, digital wallets or digital currencies. The Company believes its success depends, in part, upon its ability to address customer needs by using technology to provide products and services and create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. When launching a new product or service or introducing a new platform for the delivery of products and services, the Company might not identify or fully appreciate new operational risks arising from those innovations or might inadvertently fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate those risks. Developing and deploying new technology-driven products and services can also involve costs that the Company may not recover and divert resources away from other product development efforts. The Company may not be able to effectively develop and implement profitable new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry, including because larger competitors may have more resources to spend on developing new technologies or because non-bank competitors have a lower cost structure and more flexibility, could harm the Company\u2019s competitive position and negatively affect its revenue and profit.\n\nThe use of new technologies, including artificial intelligence (\u201cAl\u201d) and machine learning, may result in reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and increased liability The banking industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change.

Additionally, the Company\u2019s stakeholders often hold differing views on how the Company should address environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) goals as it relates to serving customers, including certain \u201canti-ESG\u201d sentiment among some individuals and government institutions. The Company's approach to ESG and customers may result in negative attention in traditional and social media, resulting in a negative perception of the Company depending on an individual\u2019s view. In addition, failure to deliver against established ESG goals and objectives could present reputational and financial harm to the Company. The Company may also be targeted by groups or influential individuals who disagree with its public positions on social or environmental issues, which could result in reduced revenue or reputational harm. If the Company is unable to design or execute against business strategies that balance conflicting views on how it supports ESG initiatives, while continuing to support customers from differing industries, reputational damage could result, leading to a loss of customers or negative investor sentiment. As a large diversified financial services company with a high industry profile, the Company is inherently exposed to this risk.\n\nIn addition, environmental matters have been the subject of increased focus by regulators, particularly with respect to the accuracy of statements made by issuers regarding their ESG practices, initiatives and investment strategies. The SEC has established an enforcement task force to examine ESG practices and disclosures by public companies and identify inaccurate or misleading statements, often referred to as \u201cgreenwashing.\u201d There have been enforcement actions relating to ESG disclosures and policies and procedures failures, and the Company expects that there will be a greater level of enforcement activity in the future. A perception or accusation of greenwashing could damage the Company's reputation, result in litigation or enforcement actions, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital and attract and retain customers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by natural disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, civil unrest or international hostilities Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of natural disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, civil unrest or international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact the Company directly (for example, by interrupting the Company's systems, which could prevent the Company from obtaining deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling its flow of business; causing significant damage to the Company's facilities; or otherwise preventing the Company from conducting business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on the Company's borrowers, depositors, other customers, vendors or other counterparties (for example, by damaging properties pledged as collateral for the Company's loans or impairing the ability of certain borrowers to repay their loans). The Company has also suffered, and could in the future suffer, adverse consequences to the extent that natural disasters, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist activities, civil unrest or international\n\n145\n\nhostilities, including Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region.",

        "text": "For example, the COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company's business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced significant disruptions to its normal operations, including the temporary closing of branches and a sudden increase in the volume of work-from-home arrangements. In addition, the Company has been indirectly negatively affected by the pandemic\u2019s effects on the Company's borrowers and other customers, and by its effects on global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic caused, and other future natural disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, civil unrest or international hostilities, may cause, an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in the Company experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\n\nDepending on the lingering impact of the pandemic and the impact of current international hostilities on general economic and market conditions, there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur or worsen, including supply chain disruptions; higher inflation; a possible recession; decreased demand for the Company's products and services or those of its borrowers, which could increase credit risk; challenges related to maintaining sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages, talent attrition, employee illness, or willingness to return to work; increased risk of cyber attacks; increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets; and disruptions to business operations at the Company and at counterparties, vendors and other service providers.\n\nThe United States has in recent years faced periods of significant civil unrest. Although civil unrest has not materially affected the Company's businesses to date, similar events could, directly or indirectly, have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations (for example, by causing shutdowns of branches or working locations of vendors or other counterparties or damaging property pledged as collateral for the Company's loans).\n\nThe Company's ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of these occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of the Company\u2019s resiliency planning, and the Company's ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse effects of natural disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, civil unrest or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that the Company transacts with, particularly those that it depends upon, but has no control over. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of some kinds of natural disasters, including wildfires, flooding, tornadoes and hurricanes, have increased, and the Company expects will continue to increase, as a result of climate change.\n\n146 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report",

        "text": "The Company\u2019s business strategy, operations, financial performance and customers could be materially adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change There is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and the impact that climate change may have on the Company and its customers and communities. The physical risks of climate change include increasing average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including wildfires, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. Climate shifts and the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters reduce the Company's ability to predict accurately the effects of natural disasters. Such disasters and chronic shifts caused by climate change, such as rising sea levels, could disrupt the Company's operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which the Company relies, particularly with respect to customers located in low-lying areas and coastlines that are more prone to flooding or other areas that are prone to wildfires and other disasters. Such disasters could also result in market volatility, negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to pay outstanding loans and fulfill other contractual obligations, reduce future relationship opportunities with clients, damage collateral or result in the deterioration of the value of collateral. Such disasters may also result in reduced availability or increased costs of insurance, including insurance that protects property pledged as collateral for Company loans, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to predict credit losses accurately.\n\nAdditionally, climate change concerns could result in transition risk. Transition risks could include changes in consumer preferences, new technologies, and additional legislation and regulatory requirements, including those associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. New regulations or laws could result in significant costs as the Company implements compliance, disclosure and other programs. Failure to comply with any new laws or regulations could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. The transition to a low-carbon economy could also negatively affect the business of customers in carbon-intensive industries and reduce their creditworthiness.\n\nThese physical risks and transition risks could increase expenses or otherwise adversely impact the Company's business strategy, operations, financial performance and customers. In particular, new regulations or guidance, or the attitudes of regulators, shareholders and employees regarding climate change, may affect the activities in which the Company engages and the products that the Company offers. An inability to adjust the Company's business to mitigate the effects of physical and transition risks could result in higher operational and credit losses. In addition, an increasing perspective that financial institutions, including the Company, play an important role in managing risks related to climate change, including indirectly with respect to their customers, may result in increased pressure on the Company to take additional steps to disclose and manage its climate risks and related lending and other activities, and the Company could suffer reputational harm related to the environmental impacts of industries in which certain of the\n\nCompany's customers do business. The Company could also experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation and technology and market changes, and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to the Company\u2019s response to climate change and the Company's climate change strategy.",

        "text": "Risks associated with climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, making it difficult to assess the effects of climate change on the Company, and the Company expects that climate change-related risks will continue to evolve and increase over time.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Risk\n\nThe Company is subject to extensive and evolving government regulation and supervision, which can increase the cost of doing business, limit the Company\u2019s ability to make investments and generate revenue, and lead to costly enforcement actions Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, the federal Deposit Insurance Fund, and the United States financial system as a whole, and not the Company's debt holders or shareholders. These regulations, and the Company's inability to act in certain instances without receiving prior regulatory approval, affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase common stock, and ability to pursue strategic acquisitions, among other activities.\n\nThe Company expects that its business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision and that the level of scrutiny and the enforcement environment may fluctuate over time, based on numerous factors, including recent bank failures, changes in the United States presidential administration or one or both houses of Congress and public sentiment regarding financial institutions (which can be influenced by scandals and other incidents that involve participants in the industry). In particular, changes in administration may result in the Company and other large financial institutions becoming subject to increased scrutiny and/or more extensive legal and regulatory requirements than under prior presidential and congressional regimes. In addition, changes in key personnel at the agencies that regulate the Company, including the federal banking regulators, may result in differing interpretations of existing rules and guidelines and potentially more stringent enforcement and more severe penalties than previously experienced. New regulations or modifications to existing regulations and supervisory expectations have increased, and may in the future increase, the Company's costs over time and necessitate changes to the Company's existing regulatory compliance and risk management infrastructure. In addition, regulatory changes may reduce the Company's revenues (including by limiting the fees the Company may charge), limit the types of financial services and products it may offer, alter the investments it makes, affect the manner in which it operates its businesses, increase its litigation and regulatory costs should it fail to appropriately comply with new or modified laws and regulatory requirements, and increase the ability of\n\nnon-banks to offer competing financial services and products.",

        "text": "Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, or their interpretation or implementation, and/or regulatory practices, requirements or expectations, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a new one percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases, which could impact the extent of the Company's common stock repurchases, preferred stock redemptions, and mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as increase the Company's tax liability and reduce the Company's net income in connection with these activities. More recently, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed capital rules, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel III Endgame\u201d, that would result in significant changes to the U.S. regulatory capital rules for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including the Company. The FDIC also issued its final rulemaking for special deposit insurance assessments to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund arising from the protection of uninsured deposits in connection with the closures of three banks in early 2023, which resulted in a significant expense for the Company. Complying with regulatory changes has at times resulted in significant expense for the Company, and these and other future regulatory changes could result in further significant expenses which could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with any new law or regulation could result in litigation, regulatory enforcement actions and harm to the Company's reputation.\n\nGeneral regulatory practices, such as longer time frames to obtain regulatory approvals for acquisitions and other activities (and the resultant impact on businesses the Company may seek to acquire), could affect the Company's ability or willingness to make certain acquisitions or introduce new products or services. In addition, the Biden Administration has called on all regulatory agencies to reduce or eliminate certain fees relating to a number of services, including banking services. Similarly, the CFPB launched an initiative to reduce the amounts and types of fees financial institutions may charge, including by issuing a proposed rule that would significantly reduce the permissible amount of credit card late fees. These and other changes could affect the Company's ability or willingness to provide certain products or services, necessitate changes to the Company's business practices or reduce the Company's revenues.\n\nFederal law grants substantial supervisory and enforcement powers to federal banking regulators and law enforcement agencies, including, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist or removal orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution- affiliated parties. The financial services industry continues to face scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and stringent enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels, including with respect to mortgage-related practices, fair lending practices, fees charged by banks, student lending practices, sales practices and related incentive\n\n147",

This regulatory scrutiny, or the results of an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries (including USBNA), which could cause the Company material financial and reputational harm. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the United States or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, another financial institution's violation of law or regulation relating to a business activity or practice often will give rise to an investigation of the same or similar activities or practices of the Company.\n\nIn general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations and the severity of other terms of regulatory settlements are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms, including admissions of wrongdoing and the imposition of monitors, as part of such settlements, which could have significant consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, reputational harm, increased exposure to civil litigation, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time.\n\nNon-compliance with sanctions laws and/or BSA/AML laws or failure to maintain an adequate BSA/AML compliance program can lead to significant monetary penalties and reputational damage. In addition, federal regulators evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering when determining whether to approve a proposed bank merger, acquisition, restructuring, or other expansionary activity. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions against banks, broker-dealers and non-bank financial institutions with respect to sanctions laws and BSA/AML laws, and some have resulted in substantial penalties, including against the Company and USBNA in 2018.\n\nViolations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management practices or consumer compliance also may be incorporated into the Company's confidential supervisory ratings. A downgrade in these ratings, or these or other regulatory actions and settlements, could limit the Company's ability to conduct expansionary activities for a period of time and require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities.\n\nDifferences in regulation can affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively The content and application of laws and regulations applicable financial institutions vary according to the size of the institution, the jurisdictions in which the institution is organized and operates and other\n\n148 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report",

        "text": "to\n\nfactors. Large institutions, such as the Company, often are subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and supervision than smaller institutions. In addition, financial technology companies and other non-bank competitors may not be subject to the prudential and consumer protection regulatory framework that applies to banks, or may be regulated by a national or state agency that does not have the same regulatory priorities or supervisory requirements as the Company's regulators. These differences in regulation can impair the Company's ability to compete effectively with competitors that are less regulated and that do not have similar compliance costs or restrictions on activities.\n\nStringent requirements related to capital and liquidity are applicable to larger banking organizations, including the Company, that may limit the Company\u2019s ability to return earnings to shareholders or operate or invest in its business The Basel III Endgame rules, discussed above, would result in significant changes to regulatory capital rules for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, such as the Company. The Company expects that the final rules will result in requirements for the Company to hold significantly more capital than is required under current regulations. In addition, in response to bank failures that occurred in 2023, the Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision and the Acting Comptroller of the Currency have indicated that the Federal Reserve and OCC, respectively, are considering additional liquidity risk management rules that they may propose in 2024. These and other future changes to the implementation of these rules including the stress capital buffer, or additional capital- and liquidity-related rules, could require the Company to take further steps to increase its capital, increase its investment security holdings, divest assets or operations, or otherwise change aspects of its capital and/or liquidity measures, including in ways that may be dilutive to shareholders or could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase its common stock, invest in its businesses or provide loans to its customers.\n\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions by the Federal Reserve Board have in the past limited and may in the future limit capital distributions, including suspension of the Company\u2019s share repurchase program or reduction or suspension of the Company's common stock dividend. In addition, recent events in the banking industry, including three high-profile bank failures in 2023, and the results of regulatory investigations into the failures could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened regulatory requirements, any of which could require the Company to expend significant time and effort to implement appropriate compliance procedures or to incur other expenses, and could negatively affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\n\nFurther, in August 2023, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued a proposed rule that would require, among other institutions, each Category III U.S. bank holding company, including the Company, and each insured depository institution with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets that is a consolidated subsidiary of a Category Ill U.S. bank holding company, such as USBNA,\n\nto have minimum levels of outstanding long-term debt. The proposed rule is intended to improve the resolvability of the banking organizations covered by the rule. The Company continues to evaluate the potential effects of the proposed rule. Although any effects on the Company and USBNA will depend on the final form of any rulemaking, the Company may need to change its current funding mix, including being required to raise additional long-term debt, which could adversely impact net interest margin and net interest income.",

        "text": "Refer to \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's capital and liquidity requirements.\n\nThe Company is subject to significant financial and reputation risks from potential legal liability and governmental actions The Company faces significant legal risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and governmental proceedings against it and other financial institutions are substantial. Customers, clients and other counterparties are making claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages, while banking regulators and certain other governmental authorities have focused on enforcement. The Company is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Company will continue to experience a high level of litigation and government scrutiny related to its businesses and operations in the future. Substantial legal liability or significant governmental action against the Company could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations (including because such matters may be resolved for amounts that exceed established accruals for a particular period) or cause significant reputational harm to the Company.\n\nFor example, banking organizations have been subject to claims regarding patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in recent years which, in some cases, have resulted in large judgments against the banks. Such claims have in the past been brought against the Company, and if the Company is not successful in defending such claims or if new claims are brought or damages sought increase, the Company may incur substantial costs in defending such claims, regardless of their merit. If such claims are successful, the Company could be required to pay substantial damages and could suffer reputational and other harm.\n\nAdditionally, the previously disclosed discontinuance of LIBOR and the complex transition of relevant contracts from LIBOR to alternative rates could still have a range of adverse impacts on the Company's business and results of operations as a result of future disputes, litigation or other actions with clients, counterparties or investors related to the transition. The transition may also result in additional inquiries or other actions from regulators regarding the Company's replacement of LIBOR.\n\nIn addition, there is an increasing focus from lawmakers and regulators concerning ESG matters. Some states in which the Company does business have implemented \u201canti-ESG\u201d measures and may seek to implement additional\n\nmeasures in the future. Such measures may conflict with other regulatory requirements or the expectations of the Company's customers and shareholders. If the Company fails to comply with evolving, and possibly conflicting, legal and regulatory requirements, it could harm the Company's ability to continue to conduct business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which the Company currently operates, or could otherwise harm the Company's business.\n\nThe Company assumed MUB\u2019s liabilities as part of the acquisition, which includes ensuring ongoing compliance with an OCC consent order relating to MUB's technology and operational risk management, and could also include other liabilities related to MUB\u2019s compliance with banking law. Although the Company may be entitled to indemnification from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. for certain losses, such liabilities could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, constraints on the Company's business, or enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or fines. Any of those events could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s future operations, financial condition, growth, or other aspects of its business.",

Contracts for residential mortgage loan sales to the GSEs include various types of specific remedies and penalties that could be applied if the Company does not adequately respond to repurchase requests. If economic conditions and the housing market deteriorate or the GSEs increase their claims for breached representations and warranties, the Company could have increased repurchase obligations and increased losses on repurchases, requiring material increases to its repurchase reserve.\n\nThe Company\u2019s failure to satisfy its obligations as servicer for automobile loan securitizations and residential mortgage loans owned by other entities, and other losses the Company could incur as servicer, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation, servicing costs or results of operations The Company services automobile loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and also acts as servicer and master servicer for mortgage loans included in securitizations and for unsecuritized mortgage loans owned by investors. As a servicer or master servicer for those loans, the Company has certain contractual obligations to the securitization trusts, investors, or other third parties. As a servicer, the Company's obligations include foreclosing on defaulted loans or, to the extent consistent with the applicable securitization or other investor agreement, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales, as applicable. In the Company's capacity as a\n\n149\n\nmaster servicer, obligations include overseeing the servicing of mortgage loans by the servicer. Generally, the Company's servicing obligations are set by contract, for which the Company receives a contractual fee. However, with respect to mortgage loans, GSEs can amend their servicing guidelines, which can increase the scope or costs of the services required without any corresponding increase in the Company's servicing fee. As a servicer, the Company also advances expenses on behalf of investors which it may be unable to collect. A material breach of the Company\u2019s obligations as servicer or master servicer may result in contract termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice. In addition, the Company may be required to indemnify the securitization trustee against losses from any failure by the Company, as a servicer or master servicer, to perform the Company's servicing obligations or any act or omission on the Company's part that involves willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence. For certain investors and certain transactions, the Company may be contractually obligated to repurchase a loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. The Company may be subject to increased repurchase obligations as a result of claims made that the Company did not satisfy its obligations as a servicer or master servicer. The Company may also experience increased loss severity on repurchases, which may require a material increase to the Company's repurchase reserve. The Company has and may continue to receive indemnification requests related to the Company's servicing of mortgage loans owned or insured by other parties, primarily GSEs.",

        "text": "in\n\nThe Company reserves for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance. The Company's allowance for credit losses is compliant with CECL\n\n150 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\naccounting guidance, under which the allowance for credit losses reflects the Company's expected lifetime loss estimates of the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is constructed based on an evaluation of the risks associated with its loan portfolio, including the size and composition of the loan portfolio, the portfolio\u2019s historical loss experience, current and foreseeable economic conditions and borrower and collateral quality. These forecasts and estimates require difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the Company's borrowers to repay their loans. The Company may not be able to accurately predict these economic conditions and/or some or all of their effects, which may, in turn, negatively impact the reliability of the process. The Company also makes loans to borrowers where it does not have or service the loan with the first lien on the property securing its loan. For loans in a junior lien position, the Company may not have access to information on the position or performance of the first lien when it is held and serviced by a third party, which may adversely affect the accuracy of the loss estimates for loans of these types. Increases in the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect its financial results. In addition, the Company's ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\nA concentration of credit and market risk in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio could increase the potential for significant losses The Company may have higher credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral. For example, high vacancy rates in commercial properties may affect the value of commercial real estate, including by causing the value of properties securing commercial real estate loans to be less than the amounts owed on such loans. In addition, elevated interest rates may make it more difficult for borrowers to refinance maturing loans. Any of these or other events could increase the level of defaults on commercial real estate loans and result in higher credit losses to the Company. The Company's credit risk and credit losses can also increase if borrowers who engage in similar activities are uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions, or by regulation, such as regulation related to climate change. Deterioration in economic conditions or real estate values in states or regions where the Company has relatively larger concentrations of residential or commercial real estate could result in higher credit costs. For example, the Company's acquisition of MUB increased the Company's exposure to the markets in California. Deterioration in real estate values and underlying economic conditions in California could result in higher credit losses to the Company.",

        "text": "Changes in interest rates can impact the value of the Company\u2019s mortgage servicing rights and mortgages held for sale, and can make its mortgage banking revenue volatile from quarter to quarter, which can reduce its earnings The Company has a portfolio of MSRs, which is the right to service a mortgage loan\u2014collect principal, interest and escrow amounts\u2014 for a fee. The Company's MSR portfolio had a fair value of $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. The Company initially carries its MSRs using a fair value measurement of the present value of the estimated future net servicing income, which includes assumptions about the likelihood of prepayment by borrowers. Changes in interest rates can affect prepayment assumptions and thus fair value. When interest rates fall, prepayments tend to increase as borrowers refinance, and the fair value of MSRs can decrease, which in turn reduces the Company's earnings. Further, it is possible that, because of economic conditions such as a weak or deteriorating housing market, even when interest rates fall, mortgage originations may fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs\u2019 value caused by the lower rates.\n\nThe Company relies on the mortgage secondary market and GSEs for some of the Company\u2019s revenue and liquidity The Company sells a portion of the mortgage loans that it originates to increase revenue through origination fees and ongoing servicing of such loans and to provide funding capacity for originating additional loans. GSEs could limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, other changes in their criteria for conforming loans or other reasons. This potential reduction in purchases could limit the Company's ability to fund new loans. In addition, if GSEs limited their purchases of conforming loans, the Company may limit its originations of mortgage loans that it intends to sell, which could reduce the Company's revenue from origination fees of such loans and the ongoing servicing fees it receives from such loans. Proposals have been presented to reform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role of the GSEs in the housing finance market. The extent and timing of any such regulatory reform of the housing finance market and the GSEs, as well as any effect on the Company's business and financial results, are uncertain.\n\nA decline in the soundness, strength or stability of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations Actual or perceived issues with, or rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or about the financial services industry more generally, have recently lead to, and may in the future lead to, among other things, (i) market-wide liquidity problems; (ii) rapid and significant deposit withdrawals at certain institutions, particularly those with elevated levels of uninsured deposits; (iii) losses or defaults by certain institutions, up to and including failures of certain banks; and (iv) significant volatility in the stock of financial services institutions. In addition, the Company's ability to engage in routine funding or settlement transactions could be adversely affected by any of these events or by other events that affect the commercial soundness of other domestic or foreign financial institutions.

Such comparisons could affect customer confidence in USBNA and lead to deposit withdrawals or other negative effects the Company is unable to predict, any of which could materially and negatively affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different counterparties, and the Company routinely executes and settles transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, the soundness, strength or stability of one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions and impact the Company's predominately United States\u2014based businesses or the less significant merchant processing, corporate trust and fund administration services businesses it operates in foreign countries. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be further increased when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due the Company. Any such losses could adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nChange in residual value of leased assets may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results The Company engages in leasing activities and is subject to the risk that the residual value of the property under lease will be less than the Company's recorded asset value. Adverse changes in the residual value of leased assets can have a negative impact on the Company's financial results. The risk of changes in the realized value of the leased assets compared to recorded residual values depends on many factors outside of the Company's control, including supply and demand for the assets, condition of the assets at the end of the lease term, and other economic factors.",

        "text": "Liquidity Risk\n\nIf the Company does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer The Company's liquidity is essential for the operation of its business. Market conditions, the threat or occurrence of a U.S. sovereign default, unforeseen outflows of funds or other events could negatively affect the Company's level or cost of funding, affecting its ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. If\n\n151\n\nthe Company's access to stable and low-cost sources of funding, such as customer deposits, is reduced, the Company might need to use alternative funding, which could be more expensive or of limited availability. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged changes in the level or cost of liquidity could materially and adversely affect the Company's business.\n\nIn addition, recent bank failures led to significant volatility in the financial services industry and to liquidity problems at certain institutions. Although governmental support was provided in connection with recent bank failures, including the FDIC's invoking the systemic risk exception to guarantee uninsured deposits, there can be no guarantee that the FDIC will invoke the systemic risk exception in connection with any future bank failures or that the government would otherwise take any action to provide liquidity to troubled institutions. Further, even if governmental support for financial institutions is available in the future, it may not be sufficient to address systemic risks.\n\nLoss of customer deposits could increase the Company\u2019s funding costs The Company relies on bank deposits to be a low-cost and stable source of funding. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits, including those that offer online channels. Recent increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing. Competition and increasing interest rates have caused the Company to increase the interest rates it pays on deposits. If the Company's competitors raise the interest rates they pay on deposits, the Company's funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises the interest rates it pays on deposits to avoid losing deposits to competitors or because the Company loses deposits to competitors and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce the Company\u2019s net interest margin and net interest income.\n\nChecking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company may lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing the Company's funding costs and reducing the Company's net interest income. In addition, mass withdrawals of deposits occurred at certain banks that failed in 2023, seemingly triggered by losses in the banks\u2019 investment securities portfolios and concerns about uninsured and uncollateralized deposits. A loss in the value of the Company's investment or loan portfolio, perceived concerns regarding the Company's and USBNA's capital positions or perceived concerns regarding the level of USBNA\u2019s uninsured and uncollateralized deposits could cause rapid and significant deposit outflows. This risk is exacerbated by technological developments and changes in banking relationships, such as customers maintaining accounts at multiple banks, which increase the ease and speed with which depositors are able to move their deposits, as well as by the way information, including false information or unfounded rumors, can be spread quickly through social media and other online channels.

To access these sources of liquidity, the Federal Reserve Board or FHLB may impose conditions that the Company and USBNA are in sound financial condition (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board or FHLB) or that the Company and USBNA maintain minimum supervisory ratings. If the Company or USBNA were to experience financial or regulatory issues, it could affect the Company's or USBNA's ability to access liquidity facilities, including at times when the Company or USBNA needs additional liquidity for the operation of its business. If the Company or USBNA were to lose access to these liquidity sources, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity needs, and the payment of those dividends is limited by laws and regulations The Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from USBNA and the Company's non-bank subsidiaries. The Company receives a significant portion of its cash from dividends paid by its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Company's stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that USBNA and certain of the Company\u2019s non-bank subsidiaries may pay to the Company without regulatory approval. Also, the Company's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors, except to the extent that any of the Company\u2019s claims as a creditor of that subsidiary may be recognized.

        "text": "Competitive and Strategic Risk\n\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results The Company operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, as well as continued industry consolidation, which may increase in connection with current economic and market conditions. This consolidation may produce larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices. The Company competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan\n\nassociations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, investment companies, credit card companies, and variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector.\n\na\n\nThe adoption and rapid growth of new technologies, including generative artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have required the Company to invest resources to adapt its systems, products and services, and it expects to continue to make similar investments. In addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services, such as loans and payment services, that traditionally were banking products, and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic, internet-based, and mobile phone-based financial solutions. Competition with non-banks, including technology companies, to provide financial products and services is intensifying. In particular, the activity financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d) has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. For example, a number of fintechs have applied for bank or industrial loan charters, which, in some cases, have been granted. In addition, other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products or payment services to their customers. Many of these companies, including the Company\u2019s competitors, have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures, in part due to lack of physical structures. Also, the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which the Company and financial services industry are highly dependent, could present operational issues and require capital spending. The Company's ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among others, its ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; developing, maintaining and building long-term customer relationships based on quality service, competitive prices, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; and industry and general economic trends. A failure to compete effectively could contribute to downward price pressure on the Company\u2019s",

There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce the Company's net interest margin and revenues from its fee-based products and services. In addition, the adoption of new technologies or further developments in current technologies require the Company to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in the Company's businesses may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The Company might not be successful in developing or\n\nintroducing new products and services, adapting to changing customer preferences and spending and saving habits (which may be altered significantly and with little warning), achieving market acceptance of its products and services, or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customer relationships.\n\nThe Company may not be able to complete future acquisitions, and completed acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated, may result in unforeseen integration difficulties, and may dilute existing shareholders\u2019 interests The Company regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial services businesses or assets and may also consider opportunities to acquire other banks or financial institutions. The Company cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions it might pursue.\n\nThe Company must generally receive federal regulatory approval before it can acquire a bank or bank holding company. The Company's ability to pursue or complete an attractive acquisition could be negatively impacted by regulatory delay or other regulatory issues. The Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be granted. For example, the Company may be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval for bank acquisitions. If the Company commits certain regulatory violations, including those that result in a downgrade in certain of the Company's bank regulatory ratings, governmental authorities could, as a consequence, preclude it from pursuing future acquisitions for a period of time. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to complete future acquisitions may depend on factors outside its control, including changes in the presidential administration or in one or both houses of Congress and public sentiment regarding bank mergers. Acquisition activity by large banking organizations, such as the Company, continues to draw regulatory and policy focus, and future changes could impact consideration of and regulatory approval processes for certain acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions by large banking organizations such as the Company may receive negative coverage in the media or negative attention by certain members of Congress or other policymakers. If the Company were to receive significant negative publicity in connection with a proposed acquisition, it could damage the Company's reputation and impede the Company's ability to complete the acquisition.",

Successful integration of an acquired company has in the past presented and may in the future present challenges due to differences in systems, operations, policies and procedures, management teams and corporate cultures and may be more costly or difficult to complete than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results.

Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected.

        "text": "Accounting and Tax Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s reported financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future The Company's accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods, so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management's judgment regarding the most appropriate manner to report the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances, yet might result in the Company's reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\n\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting the Company's financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses, estimations of fair value, the valuation of MSRs, and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided, recognize significant losses on the remeasurement of certain asset and liability balances, or significantly increase its accrued taxes liability. For more information, refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in this Annual Report. In addition, the FASB, SEC and other regulatory agencies may issue new or amend existing accounting and reporting standards or change existing interpretations of those standards that could materially affect the Company's financial statements.\n\n154 U.S. Bancorp 2023 Annual Report\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results The Company invests in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy resources. The Company\u2019s investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. The Company is subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credit and other tax benefits can have a negative impact on the Company's financial results. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside of the Company's control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed.",

        "text": "General Risk Factors\n\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Company The Company's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Company's risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Company relies on quantitative models to measure certain risks and to estimate certain financial values, and these models could fail to predict future events or exposures accurately. The Company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees, as well as manage risks associated with third parties, and could fail to do so effectively. If the Company's risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled employees The Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition for the best people in most activities the Company engages in can be intense.\n\nThe employment market has continued to evolve, influenced by macroeconomic shifts, changes in social norms post-pandemic and technology advancements. Heightened pressures on competitive pay levels and flexible work arrangements continue to be main focus areas.\n\nEmployees have also shifted their focus to expectations that extend beyond traditional compensation and benefits, including better work-life balance, improved advancement opportunities and improved training, and many businesses, including the Company, have had to adapt quickly to the changing environment. The Company's ability to compete successfully for talent has been and may continue to be affected by its ability to adapt quickly to such shifts in employee focus, and there is no assurance that these developments will not cause increased turnover or impede the Company's ability to retain and attract the highest caliber employees.\n\nA downgrade in the Company\u2019s credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity, funding costs and access to capital markets The Company's credit ratings, which are subject to credit agencies\u2019 ongoing review of a number of factors, including factors not within the Company\u2019s control, are important to the Company's liquidity. A reduction in one or more of the Company's credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity, increase its funding costs or limit its access to the capital markets. Further, a downgrade could decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or able, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Company, thereby adversely affecting the Company's competitive position. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain its current ratings and outlooks or whether or when any downgrades could occur.\n\n155",
